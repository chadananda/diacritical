    interest many readers. The record which he sets down with such devoted care is in many respects extraordinary. It has its thrilling passages, and the
    splendour of the central theme gives to the chronicle not only great historical value but high moral power. Its lights are strong; and this effect is more
    intense because they seem like a sunburst at midnight. The tale is one of struggle and martyrdom; its poignant scenes, its tragic incidents are many.
    Corruption, fanaticisms and cruelty gather against the cause of reformation to destroy it, and the present volume closes at the point where a riot of hate
    seems to have accomplished its purpose and to have driven into exile or put to death every man, woman, and child in Persia who dared to profess a leaning
    towards the teaching of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Nabíl</mark>, himself a participant in some of the scenes which he recites, took up his lonely pen to recite the truth about men and women so mercilessly
    persecuted and a movement so grievously traduced.
<p></p>He writes with ease, and when his emotions are strongly stirred his style becomes vigorous and trenchant. He does not present with any system the claims
    and teaching of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and His Forerunner. His purpose is the simple one of rehearsing the beginnings of the <mark class="term correct">Bahá’í</mark> Revelation and of preserving the
    remembrance of the deeds of its early champions. He relates a series of incidents, punctiliously quoting his authority for almost every item of
    information. His work in consequence, if less artistic and philosophic, gains in value as a literal account of what he knew or could from credible
    witnesses discover about the early history of the Cause.
<p></p>The main features of the narrative—the saintly heroic <a name="Page_xxiv"></a>figure of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, a leader so mild and so serene, yet eager, resolute, and
    dominant; the devotion of his followers facing oppression with unbroken courage and often with ecstasy; the rage of a jealous priesthood inflaming for its
    own purpose the passions of a bloodthirsty populace—these speak a language which all may understand. But it is not easy to follow the narrative in its
    details, or to appreciate how stupendous was the task undertaken by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and His Forerunner, without some knowledge of the condition of church and
    state in Persia and of the customs and mental outlook of the people and their masters <mark class="term correct">Nabíl</mark> took this knowledge for granted. He had himself travelled
    little if at all beyond the boundary of the empires of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and the <mark class="term correct">Sulṭán</mark>, and it did not occur to him to institute comparisons between his own
    and foreign civilisations. He was not addressing the Western reader. Though he was conscious that the material he had collected was of more than national
    or <mark class="term correct">Islámic</mark> importance and that it would before long spread both eastward and westward until it encircled the globe, yet he was an Oriental writing in an
    Oriental language for those who used it, and the unique work which he so faithfully accomplished was in itself a great and laborious task.
<p></p>There exists in English, however, a literature about Persia in the nineteenth century which will give the Western reader ample information on the subject.
    From Persian writings which have already been translated, or from books of European travellers like Lord Curzon, Sir J. Malcolm, and others not a few, he
    will find a lifelike and vivid if unlovely picture of the Augean conditions which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had to confront when He inaugurated the Movement in the middle of
    the nineteenth century.
<p></p>All observers agree in representing Persia as a feeble and backward nation divided against itself by corrupt practices and ferocious bigotries.
    Inefficiency and wretchedness, the fruit of moral decay, filled the land. From the highest to the lowest there appeared neither the capacity to carry out
    methods of reform nor even the will seriously to institute them National conceit preached a grandiose <mark class="term unknown">self-content</mark>. A pall of immobility lay over all
    things, and a general paralysis of mind made any development impossible. <a name="Page_xxv"></a>To a student of history the degeneracy of a nation once so powerful and so illustrious seems pitiful in the extreme. <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Bahá</mark>, who in spite of the
    cruelties heaped on <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, on the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and on Himself, yet loved His country, called their degradation “the tragedy of a people”; and in that work,
    “The Mysterious Forces of Civilisation,” in which He sought to stir the hearts of His compatriots to undertake radical reforms, He uttered a poignant
    lament over the present fate of a people who once had extended their conquests east and west and had led the civilisation of mankind. “In former times,” he
    writes, “Persia was verily the heart of the world and shone among the nations like a lighted taper. Her glory and prosperity broke from the horizon of
    humanity like the true dawn disseminating the light of knowledge and illumining the nations of the East and West. The fame of her victorious kings reached
    the ears of the dwellers at the poles of the earth. The majesty of her king of kings humbled the monarchs of Greece and Rome Her governing wisdom filled
    the sages with awe, and the rulers of the continents fashioned their laws upon her polity. The Persians being distinguished among the nations of the earth
    as a people of conquerors, and justly admired for their civilisation and learning, their country became the glorious centre of all the sciences and arts,
    the mine of culture and a fount of virtues. ...How is it that this excellent country now, by reason of our sloth, vanity, and indifference, from the lack
    of knowledge and organisation, from the poverty of the zeal and ambition of her people, has suffered the rays of her prosperity to be darkened and
    <mark class="term unknown">well-nigh</mark> extinguished?”
<p></p><p>Other writers describe fully those unhappy conditions to which <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Bahá</mark> refers.
</p>At the time when the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> declared His Mission, the government of the country was, in Lord Curzon’s phrase, “a <mark class="term unknown">Church-State</mark>.” Venal, cruel, and immoral as
    it was, it was formally religious. Muslim orthodoxy was its basis and permeated to the core both it and the social lives of the people. But otherwise there
were no laws, statutes, or charters to guide the direction of public affairs. There was no House of Lords nor Privy Council, no synod, no Parliament. The    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> was despot, and his arbitrary rule was reflected <a name="Page_xxvi"></a>all down the official scale through every minister and governor to the
    lowliest clerk or remotest headman. No civil tribunal existed to check or modify the power of the monarch or the authority which he might choose to
    delegate to his subordinates. If there was a law, it was his word. He could do as he pleased. It was his to appoint or to dismiss all ministers, officials,
    officers, and judges. He had power of life and death without appeal over all members of his household and of his court, whether civil or military. The
    right to take life was vested in him alone; and so were all the functions of government, legislative, executive, and judicial. His royal prerogative was
    limited by no written restraint whatever.
<p></p>Descendants of the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>áhs</mark><mark class="term correction">Sháhs</mark> were thrust into the most lucrative posts throughout the country, and as the generations went by they filled innumerable
    minor posts too, far and wide, till the land was burdened with this race of royal drones who owed their position to nothing better than their blood and who
    gave rise to the Persian saying that “camels, fleas, and princes exist everywhere.”
<p></p><p>Even when a <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> wished to make a just and wise decision in any case that might be brought before him for judgment, he found it difficult to do so,
    because he could not rely on the information given him. Critical facts would be withheld, or the facts given would be distorted by the influence of
    interested witnesses or venal ministers. The system of corruption had been carried so far in Persia that it had become a recognised institution which Lord
    Curzon describes in the following terms:
</p>“I come now to that which is the cardinal and differentiating feature of Iranian administration. Government, nay, life itself, in that country may be said
    to consist for the most part of an interchange of presents. Under its social aspects this practice may be supposed to illustrate the generous sentiments of
    an amiable people; though even here it has a grimly unemotional side, as, for instance, when, congratulating yourself upon being the recipient of a gift,
    you find that not only must you make a return of equivalent cost to the donor, but must also liberally remunerate the bearer of the gift (to whom your
    return is very likely the sole recognised means of subsistence) in a ratio proportionate <a name="Page_xxvii"></a>to its pecuniary value. Under its
    political aspects, the practice of <mark class="term unknown">gift-making</mark>, though consecrated in the adamantine traditions of the East, is synonymous with the system elsewhere
    described by less agreeable names. This is the system on which the government of Persia has been conducted for centuries, and the maintenance of which
    opposes a solid barrier to any real reform. From the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> downwards, there is scarcely an official who is not open to gifts, scarcely a post which
    is not conferred in return for gifts, scarcely an income which has not been amassed by the receipt of gifts. Every individual, with hardly an exception, in
    the official hierarchy above mentioned, has only purchased his post by a money present either to the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, or to a minister, or to the superior
    governor by whom he has been appointed. If there are several candidates for a post, in all probability the one who makes the best offer will win.
<p></p>“...The ‘<mark class="term misspelled">mada<u>kh</u>il</mark><mark class="term correction">madá<u>kh</u>il</mark>’ is a cherished national institution in Persia, the exaction of which, in a myriad different forms, whose ingenuity is only
    equalled by their multiplicity, is the crowning interest and delight of a Persian’s existence. This remarkable word, for which Mr. Watson says there is no
    precise English equivalent, may be variously translated as commission, perquisite, douceur, consideration, pickings and stealings, profit, according to the
    immediate context in which it is employed. Roughly speaking, it signifies that balance of personal advantage, usually expressed in money form, which can be
    squeezed out of any and every transaction. A negotiation, in which two parties are involved as donor and recipient, as superior and subordinate, or even as
    equal contracting agents, cannot take place in Persia without the party who can be represented as the author of the favour or service claiming and
    receiving a definite cash return for what he has done or given. It may of course be said that human nature is much the same all the world over; that a
    similar system exists under a different name in our own or other countries, and that the philosophic critic will welcome in the Persian a man and a
    brother. To some extent this is true. But in no country that I have ever seen or heard of in the world, is the system so open, so shameless, or so
    universal as in Persia. So far from being limited to the sphere of <a name="Page_xxviii"></a>domestic economy or to commercial transactions, it permeates
    every walk and inspires most of the actions of life. By its operation, generosity or gratuitous service may be said to have been erased in Persia from the
    category of social virtues, and cupidity has been elevated into the guiding principle of human conduct.... Hereby is instituted an arithmetical progression
    of plunder from the sovereign to the subject, each unit in the descending scale remunerating himself from the unit next in rank below his, and the hapless
    peasant being the ultimate victim. It is not surprising, under these circumstances, that office is the common avenue to wealth, and that cases are frequent
    of men who, having started from nothing, are found residing in magnificent houses, surrounded by crowds of retainers and living in princely style. <mark class="term unknown">‘Make</mark>
    what you can while you <mark class="term unknown">can’</mark> is the rule that most men set before themselves in entering public life. Nor does popular spirit resent the act; the estimation
    of any one who, enjoying the opportunity, has failed to line his own pockets, being the reverse of complimentary to his sense. No one turns a thought to
    the sufferers from whom, in the last resort, the material for these successive ‘<mark class="term misspelled">mada<u>kh</u>ils</mark><mark class="term correction">madá<u>kh</u>ils</mark>’ has been derived, and from the sweat of whose
    uncomplaining brow has been wrung the wealth that is dissipated in luxurious country houses, European curiosities and enormous retinues.”
<p></p><p>To read the foregoing is to perceive something of the difficulty of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s mission; to read the following is to understand the dangers he faced, and to
    be prepared for a story of violence and heinous cruelty.
</p>“Before I quit the subject of the Persian law and its administration, let me add a few words upon the subject of penalties and prisons. Nothing is more
    shocking to the European reader, in pursuing his way through the <mark class="term unknown">crime-stained</mark> and bloody pages of Persian history during the last and, in a happily less
    degree, during the present century, than the record of savage punishments and abominable tortures, testifying alternately to the callousness of the brute
    and the ingenuity of the fiend. The Persian character has ever been fertile in device and indifferent to suffering; and in the field of judicial executions
    it has found ample scope for the exercise of both attainments. Up till quite a recent <a name="Page_xxix"></a>period, well within the borders of the
    present reign, condemned criminals have been crucified, blown from guns, buried alive, impaled, shod like horses, torn asunder by being bound to the heads
    of two trees bent together and then allowed to spring back to their natural position, converted into human torches, flayed while living.
<p></p>“...Under a twofold governing system, such as that of which I have now completed the description—namely, an administration in which every actor is, in
    different aspects, both the briber and the bribed; and a judicial procedure, without either a law or a law court—it will readily be understood that
    confidence in the Government is not likely to exist, that there is no personal sense of duty or pride of honour, no mutual trust or <mark class="term unknown">co-operation</mark> (except in
    the service of <mark class="term unknown">ill-doing</mark>), no disgrace in exposure, no credit in virtue, above all no national spirit or patriotism.”
<p></p><p>From the beginning the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> must have divined the reception which would be accorded by His countrymen to His teachings, and the fate which awaited Him at
    the hands of the <mark class="term correct">mullás</mark>. But He did not allow personal misgivings to affect the frank enunciation of His claims nor the open presentation of His Cause. The
    innovations which He proclaimed, though purely religious, were drastic; the announcement of His own identity startling and tremendous. He made Himself
    known as the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>, the High Prophet or Messiah so long promised, so eagerly expected by the <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadan</mark> world. He added to this the declaration that he was
    also the Gate (that is, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>) through whom a greater Manifestation than Himself was to enter the human realm.
</p>Putting Himself thus in line with the traditions of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, and appearing as the fulfilment of prophecy, He came into conflict with those who had fixed and
    ineradicable ideas (different from His) as to what those prophecies and traditions meant. The two great Persian sects of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark> and the
    <mark class="term unknown">sunnís</mark>, both attached vital importance to the ancient deposit of their faith but did not agree as to its contents or its import. The <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark>, out of
    whose doctrines the <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> Movement rose, held that after the ascension of the High Prophet <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> He was succeeded by a line of twelve <mark class="term correct">Imáms</mark>. Each of
    these, they held, was specially endowed <a name="Page_xxx"></a>by God with spiritual gifts and powers, and was entitled to the <mark class="term unknown">whole-hearted</mark> obedience of
    the faithful. Each owed his appointment not to the popular choice but to his nomination by his predecessor in office. The twelfth and last of these
    inspired guides was <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, called by the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark> “<mark class="term correct">Imám-Mihdí</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjatu’lláh</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjatu’lláh</mark> [the Proof of God], <mark class="term unknown">Bagíyyatu’lláh</mark> [the Remnant of God], and
    <mark class="term unknown">Qá’im-i-‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark> [He who shall arise of the family of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>].” He assumed the functions of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> in the year 260 of the Hegira, but at once
    disappeared from view and communicated with his followers only through a certain chosen intermediary known as a Gate. Four of these Gates followed one
    another in order, each appointed by his predecessor with the approval of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark>. But when the fourth, <mark class="term misspelled">Abu’l-Ḥasan-Alí</mark><mark class="term correction">Abu’l-Ḥasan-‘Alí</mark>, was asked by the faithful, before
    he died, to name his successor, he declined to do so. He said that God had another plan. On his death all communication between the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> and his church
    therefore ceased. And though, surrounded by a band of followers, he still lives and waits in some mysterious retreat, he will not resume relations with his
    people until he comes forth in power to establish a millennium throughout the world.
<p></p>The <mark class="term unknown">sunnís</mark>, on the other hand, take a less exalted view of the office of those who have succeeded the High Prophet. They regard the vicegerency less as a
    spiritual than as a practical matter. The <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>alíf</mark> is, in their eyes, the Defender of the Faith, and he owes his appointment to the choice and
    approval of the People.
<p></p>Important as these differences are, both sects agree, however, in expecting a twofold Manifestation. The <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ahs</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ahs</mark> look for the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>, who is to come
    in the fulness of time, and also for the return of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. The <mark class="term unknown">sunnís</mark> await the appearance of the <mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark> and also “the return of Jesus Christ.”
    When, at the beginning of his Mission, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, continuing the tradition of the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ahs</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ahs</mark>, proclaimed His function under the double title of, first,
    the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> and, second, the Gate, or <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, some of the <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadans</mark> misunderstood the latter reference. They imagined His meaning to be that He was a fifth
    Gate In succession to <mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Ḥasan-‘Alí</mark>. His true meaning, however, as He himself clearly announced, was very <a name="Page_xxxi"></a>different. He was the
    <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>; but the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>, though a High Prophet, stood in relation to a succeeding and greater Manifestation as did John the Baptist to the Christ. He was the
    Forerunner of One yet more mighty than Himself. He was to decrease; that Mighty One was to increase. And as John the Baptist had been the Herald or Gate of
    the Christ, so was the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> the Herald or Gate of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>.
<p></p>There are many authentic traditions showing that the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> on His appearance would bring new laws with Him and would thus abrogate <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. But this was not
    the understanding of the established hierarchy. They confidently expected that the promised Advent would not substitute a new and richer revelation for the
    old, but would endorse and fortify the system of which they were the functionaries. It would enhance incalculably their personal prestige, would extend
    their authority far and wide among the nations, and would win for them the reluctant but abject homage of mankind. When the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> revealed His <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark>,
    proclaimed a new code of religious law, and by precept and example instituted a profound moral and spiritual reform, the priests immediately scented mortal
    danger. They saw their monopoly undermined, their ambitions threatened, their own lives and conduct put to shame. They rose against Him in sanctimonious
    indignation. They declared before the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and all the people that this upstart was an enemy of sound learning, a subverter of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, a traitor to
    <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, and a peril not only to the holy church but to the social order and to the State itself.
<p></p>The cause of the rejection and persecution of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was in its essence the same as that of the rejection and persecution of the Christ. If Jesus had not
    brought a New Book, if He had not only reiterated the spiritual principles taught by Moses but had continued <mark class="term unknown">Moses’</mark> rules and regulations too, He might as
    a merely moral reformer have escaped the vengeance of the Scribes and Pharisees. But to claim that any part of the Mosaic law, even such material
    ordinances as those that dealt with divorce and the keeping of the Sabbath, could be altered—and altered by an unordained preacher from the village of
    Nazareth—this was to threaten the interests of the Scribes and Pharisees themselves, and <a name="Page_xxxii"></a>since they were the representatives of
    Moses and of God, it was blasphemy against the Most High. As soon as the position of Jesus was understood, His persecution began. As He refused to desist,
    He was put to death.
<p></p>For reasons exactly parallel, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was from the beginning opposed by the vested interests of the dominant Church as an uprooter of the Faith. Yet, even
    in that dark and fanatical country, the <mark class="term correct">mullás</mark> (like the Scribes in Palestine eighteen centuries before) did not find it very easy to put forward a
    plausible pretext for destroying Him whom they thought their enemy.
<p></p>The only known record of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s having been seen by a European belongs to the period of His persecution when an English physician resident in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>,
    Dr. Cormick, was called in by the Persian authorities to pronounce on the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s mental condition. The doctor’s letter, addressed to a fellow practitioner
    in an American mission in Persia, is given in Professor E. G. Browne’s “Materials for the Study of the <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> Religion.” “You ask me,” writes the doctor,
    “for some particulars of my interview with the founder of the sect known as <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>. Nothing of any importance transpired in this interview, as the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was
    aware of my having been sent with two other Persian doctors to see whether he was of sane mind or merely a madman, to decide the question whether he was to
    be put to death or not. With this knowledge he was loth to answer any questions put to him. To all enquiries he merely regarded us with a mild look,
    chanting in a low melodious voice some hymns, I suppose. Two other siyyids, his intimate friends, were also present, who subsequently were put to death
    with him, besides a couple of government officials. He only deigned to answer me, on my saying that I was not a Musulman and was willing to know something
    about his religion, as I might perhaps be inclined to adopt it. He regarded me very intently on my saying this, and replied that he had no doubt of all
    Europeans coming over to his religion. Our report to the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> at that time was of a nature to spare his life. He was put to death some time after by
    the order of the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. On our report he merely got the bastinado, in which operation a <mark class="term correct">farrá<u>sh</u></mark>, whether intentionally
    or not, struck him <a name="Page_xxxiii"></a>across the face with the stick destined for his feet, which produced a great wound and swelling of the face.
    On being asked whether a Persian surgeon should be brought to treat him, he expressed a desire that I should be sent for, and I accordingly treated him for
    a few days, but in the interviews consequent on this I could never get him to have a confidential chat with me, as some government people were always
    present, he being a prisoner. He was a very mild and <mark class="term unknown">delicate-looking</mark> man, rather small in stature and very fair for a Persian, with a melodious soft
    voice, which struck me much. Being a <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>, he was dressed in the habit of that sect, as were also his two companions. In fact his whole look and
    deportment went far to dispose one in his favour. Of his doctrine I heard nothing from his own lips, although the idea was that there existed in his
    religion a certain approach to Christianity. He was seen by some Armenian carpenters, who were sent to make some repairs in his prison, reading the Bible,
    and he took no pains to conceal it, but on the contrary told them of it. Most assuredly the Musulman fanaticism does not exist in his religion, as applied
    to Christians, nor is there that restraint of females that now exists.”
<p></p><p>Such was the impression made by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> upon a cultivated Englishman. And as far as the influence of His character and teaching have since spread through
    the West, no other record is extant of His having been observed or seen by European eyes.
</p>His qualities were so rare in their nobility and beauty, His personality so gentle and yet so forceful, and His natural charm was combined with so much
    tact and judgment, that after His Declaration He quickly became in Persia a widely popular figure. He would win over almost all with whom He was brought
    into personal contact, often converting His gaolers to His Faith and turning the <mark class="term unknown">ill-disposed</mark> into admiring friends.
<p></p>To silence such a man without incurring some degree of public odium was not very easy even in the Persia of the middle of last century. But with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s
    followers it was another matter.
<p></p>The <mark class="term correct">mullás</mark> encountered here no cause for delay and found little need for scheming. The bigotry of the <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadans</mark><a name="Page_xxxiv"></a>from the    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> downwards could be readily roused against any religious development. The <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> could be accused of disloyalty to the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, and dark
    political motives could be attributed to their activities. Moreover, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s followers were already numerous; many of them were <mark class="term unknown">well-to-do</mark>, some were
    rich, and there were few but had some possessions which covetous neighbours might be instigated to desire. Appealing to the fears of the authorities and to
    the base national passions of fanaticism and cupidity, the <mark class="term correct">mullás</mark> inaugurated a campaign of outrage and spoliation which they maintained with relentless
    ferocity till they considered that their purpose had been completely achieved.
<p></p>Many of the incidents of this unhappy story are given by <mark class="term correct">Nabíl</mark> in his history, and among these the happenings at <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> stand out
    by reason of the character of the episodes of the heroism of the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> when thus brought to bay. On these three occasions a number of <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>, driven to
    desperation, withdrew in concert from their houses to a chosen retreat and, erecting defensive works about them, defied in arms further pursuit. To any
    impartial witness it was evident that the <mark class="term misspelled">mullás’</mark><mark class="term correction">mullás</mark> allegations of a political motive were untrue. The <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> showed themselves always ready—on an assurance
    that they would be no longer molested for their religious beliefs—to return peacefully to their civil occupations. <mark class="term correct">Nabíl</mark> emphasises their care to refrain
    from aggression. They would fight for their lives with determined skill and strength; but they would not attack. Even in the midst of a fierce conflict
    they would not drive home an advantage nor strike an unnecessary blow.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Bahá</mark> is quoted in the “Traveller’s Narrative,” pp. 34–35, as making the following statement on the moral aspect of their action:
<p></p>“The minister (<mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>), with the utmost arbitrariness, without receiving any instructions or asking permission, sent forth commands in all
    directions to punish and chastise the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>. Governors and magistrates sought a pretext for amassing wealth, and officials a means of acquiring profits;
    celebrated doctors from the summits of their pulpits incited men to make a general onslaught; the powers of the religious and the civil law linked hands
    and strove to eradicate <a name="Page_xxxv"></a>and destroy this people. Now this people had not yet acquired such knowledge as was right and needful of
    the fundamental principles and hidden doctrines of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s teachings, and did not recognise their duties. Their conceptions and ideas were after the
    former fashion, and their conduct and behaviour in correspondence with ancient usage. The way of approach to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was, moreover, closed, and the flame
    of trouble visibly blazing on every side. At the decree of the most celebrated doctors, the government, and indeed the common people, had, with
    irresistible power, inaugurated rapine and plunder on all sides, and were engaged in punishing and torturing, killing and despoiling, in order that they
    might quench this fire and wither these poor souls. In towns where there were but a limited number, all of them with bound hands became food for the sword,
    while in cities where they were numerous, they arose in <mark class="term unknown">self-defence</mark> in accordance with their former beliefs, since it was impossible for them to make
    enquiry as to their duty, and all doors were closed.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, on proclaiming some years later His Mission, left no room for uncertainty as to the law of His Dispensation in such a predicament when He
    affirmed: “It is better to be killed than to kill.”
</p><p>Whatever resistance the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> offered, here or elsewhere, proved ineffective. They were overwhelmed by numbers. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> Himself was taken from His cell and
    executed. Of His chief disciples who avowed their belief in Him, not one soul was left alive save <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, who with His family and a handful of devoted
    followers was driven destitute into exile and prison in a foreign land.
</p>But the fire, though smothered, was not quenched. It burned in the hearts of the exiles who carried it from country to country as they travelled. Even in
    the homeland of Persia it had penetrated too deeply to be extinguished by physical violence, and still smouldered in the people’s hearts, needing only a
    breath from the spirit to be fanned into an <mark class="term unknown">all-consuming</mark> conflagration.
<p></p>The Second and greater Manifestation of God was proclaimed in accordance with the prophecy of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> at the date which He had foretold. Nine years after
    the beginning <a name="Page_xxxvi"></a>of the <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> Dispensation—that is, in 1853—<mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, in certain of His odes, alluded to His identity and His
    Mission, and ten years later, while resident in <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>, declared Himself as the Promised One to His companions.
<p></p>Now the great Movement for which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had prepared the way began to show the full range and magnificence of its power. Though <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> Himself lived
    and died an exile and a prisoner and was known to few Europeans, His epistles proclaiming the new Advent were borne to the great rulers of both
    hemispheres, from the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> of Persia to the Pope and to the President of the United States. After His passing, His son <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Bahá</mark> carried the
    tidings in person into Egypt and far through the Western world. <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Bahá</mark> visited England, France, Switzerland, Germany, and America, announcing
    everywhere that once again the heavens had opened and that a new Dispensation had come to bless the sons of men. He died in November, 1921; and <mark class="term unknown">to-day</mark> the
    fire that once seemed to have been put out for ever, burns again in every part of Persia, has established itself on the American continent, and has laid
    hold of every country in the world. Around the sacred writings of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and the authoritative exposition of <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Bahá</mark> there is growing a large
    volume of literature in comment or in witness. The humanitarian and spiritual principles enunciated decades ago in the darkest East by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and
    moulded by Him into a coherent scheme are one after the other being taken by a world unconscious of their source as the marks of progressive civilisation.
    And the sense that mankind has broken with the past and that the old guidance will not carry it through the emergencies of the present has filled with
    uncertainty and dismay all thoughtful men save those who have learned to find in the story of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> the meaning of all the prodigies and portents of
    our time.
<p></p>Nearly three generations have passed since the inception of the Movement. Any of its early adherents who escaped the sword and the stake have long since
    passed away in the course of nature. The door of contemporary information as to its two great leaders and their heroic disciples is closed for ever. The
    Chronicle of <mark class="term correct">Nabíl</mark> as a careful collection of facts made in the interests of truth and completed in the <a name="Page_xxxvii"></a>lifetime of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>
    has now a unique value. The author was thirteen years old when the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> declared Himself, having been born in the village of <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark> in Persia on the
    eighteenth day of <mark class="term misspelled">Safar</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣafar</mark>, 1247 A.H. He was throughout his life closely associated with the leaders of the Cause. Though he was but a boy at the time, he was
    preparing to leave for <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> and join the party of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> when the news of the treacherous massacre of the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> frustrated
    his design. He states in his narrative that he met, in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, a brother of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s mother, who had just returned at the time
    from visiting the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in the fortress of <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>; and for many years he was a close companion of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s secretary, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>.
<p></p>He entered the presence of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in <mark class="term misspelled">Kirman<u>sh</u>áh</mark><mark class="term correction">Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> before the date of the exile to <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, and afterwards was in attendance upon Him in
    <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark> and Adrianople as well as in the <mark class="term unknown">prison-city</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Akká</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Akká</mark>. He was sent more than once on missions to Persia to promote the Cause and to encourage
    the scattered and persecuted believers, and he was living in <mark class="term misspelled">Akká</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Akká</mark> when <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> passed away in 1892 A.D. The manner of his death was pathetic and
    lamentable, for he became so dreadfully affected by the death of the Great Beloved that, overmastered by grief, he drowned himself in the sea, and his dead
    body was found washed ashore near the city of <mark class="term misspelled">Akká</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Akká</mark>.
<p></p>His chronicle was begun in 1888, when he had the personal assistance of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Músá</mark>, the brother of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. It was finished in about a year and a half,
    and parts of the manuscript were reviewed and approved, some by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, and others by <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Bahá</mark>.
<p></p>The complete work carries the history of the Movement up to the death of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in 1892.
<p></p>The first half of this narrative, closing with the expulsion of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> from Persia, is contained in the present volume. Its importance is evident. It
    will be read less for the few stirring passages of action which it contains, or even for its many pictures of heroism and unwavering faith, than for the
    abiding significance of those events of which it gives so unique a record. <a name="Page_xxxviii"></a>PERSIA’S STATE OF DECADENCE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURYA. THE <mark class="term correct">QÁJÁR</mark> SOVEREIGNS“In theory the king may do what he pleases; his word is law. The saying that <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> law of the Medes and Persians altereth <mark class="term unknown">not’</mark> was merely an ancient
    periphrasis for the absolutism of the sovereign. He appoints and he may dismiss all ministers, officers, officials, and judges. Over his own family and
    household, and over the civil or military functionaries in his employ, he has power of life and death without reference to any tribunal. The property of
    any such individual, if disgraced or executed, reverts to him. The right to take life in any case is vested in him alone, but can be delegated to governors
    or deputies. All property, not previously granted by the crown or purchased—all property, in fact, to which a legal title cannot be established—belongs to
    him, and can be disposed of at his pleasure. All rights or privileges, such as the making of public works, the working of mines, the institution of
    telegraphs, roads, railroads, tramways, etc., the exploitation, in fact, of any of the resources of the country, are vested in him, and must be purchased
    from him before they can be assumed by others. In his person are fused the threefold functions of government, legislative, executive, and judicial. No
    obligation is imposed upon him beyond the outward observance of the forms of the national religion. He is the pivot upon which turns the entire machinery
    of public life.
<p></p>“Such is, in theory, and was till lately in practice, the character of the Persian monarchy. Nor has a single one of these high pretensions been overtly
    conceded. The language in which the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> addresses his subjects and is addressed by them, recalls the proud tone in which an Artaxerxes or Darius
    spoke to his tributary millions, and which may still be read in the graven record of <mark class="term unknown">rock-wall</mark> and tomb. He remains the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áhin<u>sh</u>áh</mark>, or King
    of Kings; the <mark class="term misspelled">Zillu’llah</mark><mark class="term correction">Ẓillu’lláh</mark>, or Shadow of God; the <mark class="term misspelled">Qibliy-i-’Alam</mark><mark class="term correction">Qibliy-i-‘Álam</mark>, or Centre of the Universe; <mark class="term unknown">‘Exalted</mark> like the planet Saturn; Well of Science; Footpath of
    Heaven; Sublime Sovereign, whose standard is the Sun, whose splendour is that of the Firmament; Monarch of armies numerous <a name="Page_xxxix"></a>as the
    stars.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Still would the Persian subject endorse the precept of <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’dí</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘dí</mark>, that <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> vice approved by the king becomes a virtue; to seek opposite counsel is to
    imbrue one’s hands in his own blood.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The march of time has imposed upon him neither religious council nor secular council, neither <mark class="term unknown">‘ulamá</mark> nor senate.
    Elective and representative institutions have not yet intruded their irreverent features. No written check exists upon the royal prerogative.
<p></p>“...Such is the divinity that doth hedge a throne in Persia, that not merely does the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> never attend at state dinners or eat with his subjects at
    table, with the exception of a single banquet to his principal male relatives at <mark class="term correct">Naw-rúz</mark>, but the attitude and language employed towards him even by his
    confidential ministers are those of servile obeisance and adulation. <mark class="term unknown">‘May</mark> I be your sacrifice, Asylum of the Universe,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> is the common mode of address
    adopted even by subjects of the highest rank. In his own surrounding there is no one to tell him the truth or to give him dispassionate counsel. The
    foreign Ministers are probably almost the only source from which he learns facts as they are, or receives unvarnished, even if interested, advice. With the
    best intentions in the world for the undertaking of great plans and for the amelioration of his country, he has little or no control over the execution of
    an enterprise which has once passed out of his hands and has become the sport of corrupt and <mark class="term unknown">self-seeking</mark> officials. Half the money voted with his consent
    never reaches its destination, but sticks to every intervening pocket with which a professional ingenuity can bring it into transient contact; half the
    schemes authorised by him are never brought any nearer to realisation, the minister or functionary in charge trusting to the oblivious caprices of the
    sovereign to overlook his dereliction of duty.
<p></p>“...Only a century ago the abominable system prevailed of blinding possible aspirants to the throne, of savage mutilations and <mark class="term unknown">life-long</mark> captivities, of
    wanton slaughter and systematic bloodshed. Disgrace was not less sudden than promotion, and death was a frequent concomitant of disgrace.
<p></p>“...<mark class="term correct">Fatḥ-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> ... and his successors after him, have proved so extraordinarily prolific of male offspring that the continuity of the dynasty
    has been assured; and there is <a name="Page_xl"></a>probably not a reigning family in the world that in the space of one hundred years has swollen to such
    ample dimensions as the royal race of Persia.... Neither in the number of his wives nor in the extent of his progeny, can the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, although
    undeniably a family man, be compared with his <mark class="term unknown">great-grandfather</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Fatḥ-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>. To the high opinion universally held of the domestic capacities of
    that monarch must, I imagine, be attributed the divergent estimates that are to be found, in works about Persia, of the number of his concubines and
    children. Colonel Drouville, in 1813, credits him with 700 wives, 64 sons, and 125 daughters. Colonel Stuart, who was in Persia in the year after
    <mark class="term correct">Fatḥ-‘Alí</mark>’s death, gives him 1,000 wives and 105 children.... Madame Dieulafoy also names the 5,000 descendants, but as existing at an epoch fifty years
    later (which has an air of greater probability).... The estimate which appears in the <mark class="term unknown">Nasi<u>kh</u>u’t</mark><mark class="term unknown">Tavarí<u>kh</u></mark>, a great modern Persian historical
    work, fixes the number of <mark class="term correct">Fatḥ-‘Alí</mark>’s wives as over 1,000, and of his offspring as 260, 110 of whom survived their father. Hence the familiar Persian
    proverb <mark class="term unknown">‘Camels</mark>, fleas, and princes exist everywhere.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> ...No royal family has ever afforded a more exemplary illustration of the Scriptural assurance,
    <mark class="term unknown">‘Instead</mark> of thy fathers thou shalt have children, whom thou mayest make princes in all <mark class="term unknown">lands’</mark>; for there was scarcely a governorship or a post of emolument
    in Persia that was not filled by one of this beehive of princelings; and to this day the myriad brood of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh-zádihs</mark>, or descendants of a king, is a
    perfect curse to the country, although many of these luckless scions of royalty, who consume a large portion of the revenue in annual allowances and
    pensions, now occupy very inferior positions as telegraph clerks, secretaries, etc. Fraser drew a vivid picture of the misery entailed upon the country
    fifty years ago (1842) by this <mark class="term unknown">‘race</mark> of royal drones,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> who filled the governing posts not merely of every province, but of every buluk or district, city,
    and town; each of whom kept up a court, and a huge harem, and who preyed upon the country like a swarm of locusts.... Fraser, passing through A<u>dh</u><mark class="term unknown">arbayján</mark> in 1834, and observing the calamitous results of the system under which <mark class="term correct">Fatḥ-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> distributed his colossal male progeny in every
    Government post throughout the kingdom, remarked: <a name="Page_xli"></a><mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> most obvious consequence of this state of affairs is a thorough and universal
    detestation of the <mark class="term correct">Qájár</mark> race, which is a prevalent feeling in every heart and the theme of every tongue.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“...Just as, in the course of his [<mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s] European travels, he picked up a vast number of what appeared, to the Eastern mind, to be
    wonderful curiosities, but which have since been stacked in the various apartments of the palace, or put away and forgotten; so in the larger sphere of
    public policy and administration he is continually taking up and pushing some new scheme or invention which, when the caprice has been gratified, is
    neglected or allowed to expire. One week it is gas; another it is electric lights. Now it is a staff college; anon, a military hospital. <mark class="term unknown">To-day</mark> it is a
    Russian uniform; yesterday it was a German <mark class="term unknown">man-of-war</mark> for the Persian Gulf. A new army warrant is issued this year; a new code of law is promised for the
    next. Nothing comes of any of these brilliant schemes, and the <mark class="term unknown">lumber-rooms</mark> of the palace are not more full of broken mechanism and discarded bric-à-brac
    than are the <mark class="term unknown">pigeon-holes</mark> of the government bureaux of abortive reforms and dead fiascoes.
</p>“...In an upper chamber of the same pavilion, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im-Maqám</mark>, or Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> (the father of the present
    monarch), was strangled in 1835, by order of his royal master, who therein followed an example set him by his predecessor, and set one himself that was
    duly followed by his son. It must be rare in history to find three successive sovereigns who have put to death, from jealous motives only, the three
    ministers who have either raised them to the throne or were at the time of their fall filling the highest office in the State. Such is the triple
    distinction of <mark class="term correct">Fatḥ-‘Alí</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>áhs</mark><mark class="term correction">Sháhs</mark>.”
<p></p><h4>B. THE GOVERNMENT
</h4>“In a country so backward in constitutional progress, so destitute of forms and statutes and charters, and so firmly stereotyped in the immemorial
    traditions of the East, the personal element, as might be expected, is largely in the ascendant; and the government of Persia is little else than the
    arbitrary exercise of authority by a series of units in a <a name="Page_xlii"></a>descending scale from the sovereign to the headman of a petty village.
    The only check that operates upon the lower official grades is the fear of their superiors, which means can usually be found to assuage; upon the higher
    ranks the fear of the sovereign, who is not always closed against similar methods of pacification; and upon the sovereign himself the fear, not of native,
    but of foreign opinion, as represented by the hostile criticism of the European Press.... The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, indeed, may be regarded at this moment as
    perhaps the best existing specimen of a moderate despot; for within the limits indicated he is practically irresponsible and omnipotent. He has absolute
    command over the life and property of every one of his subJects. His sons have no independent power, and can be reduced to impotence or beggary in the
    twinkling of an eye. The ministers are elevated and degraded at the royal pleasure. The sovereign is the sole executive, and all officials are his
    deputies. No civil tribunals are in existence to check or modify his prerogative.
<p></p>“...Of the general character and accomplishments of the ministers of the Persian Court, Sir J. Malcolm, in his History, wrote as follows in the early years
    of the century: <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> Ministers and chief officers of the Court are almost always men of polished manners, well skilled in the business of their respective
    departments, of pleasant conversation, subdued temper, and very acute observation; but these agreeable and useful qualities are, in general, all that they
    possess. Nor is virtue or liberal knowledge to be expected in men whose lives are wasted in attending to forms; whose means of subsistence are derived from
    the most corrupt sources; whose occupation is in intrigues which have always the same objects: to preserve themselves or ruin others; who cannot, without
    danger, speak any language but that of flattery and deceit; and who are, in short, condemned by their condition to be venal, artful, and false. There have,
    no doubt, been many ministers of Persia whom it would be injustice to class under this general description; but even the most distinguished for their
    virtues and talents have been forced in some degree to accommodate their principles to their station; and, unless where the confidence of their sovereign
    has placed them beyond the fear of rivals, necessity has compelled them to <a name="Page_xliii"></a>practise a subserviency and dissimulation at variance
    with the truth and integrity which can alone constitute a claim to the respect all are disposed to grant to good and great men.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> These observations are
    marked by the insight and justice characteristic of their distinguished author, and it is to be feared that to a large extent they hold as good of the
    present as of the old generation.”
<p></p><h4>C. THE PEOPLE
</h4>“...I now come to that which is the cardinal and differentiating feature of Iranian administration. Government, nay, life itself, in that country may be
    said to consist for the most part of an interchange of presents. Under its social aspects this practice may be supposed to illustrate the generous
    sentiments of an amiable people; though even here it has a grimly unemotional side, as, for instance, when, congratulating yourself upon being the
    recipient of a gift, you find that not only must you make a return of equivalent cost to the donor, but must also liberally remunerate the bearer of the
    gift (to whom your return is very likely the sole recognised means of subsistence) in a ratio proportionate to its pecuniary value. Under its political
    aspects, the practice of <mark class="term unknown">gift-making</mark>, though consecrated in the adamantine traditions of the East, is synonymous with the system elsewhere described by
    less agreeable names. This is the system on which the government of Persia has been conducted for centuries, and the maintenance of which opposes a solid
    barrier to any real reform. From the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> downwards, there is scarcely an official who is not open to gifts, scarcely a post which is not conferred
    in return for gifts, scarcely an income which has not been amassed by the receipt of gifts. Every individual, with hardly an exception, in the official
    hierarchy above mentioned, has only purchased his post by a money present either to the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, or to a minister, or to the superior governor by whom
    he has been appointed. If there are several candidates for a post, in all probability the one who makes the best offer will win.
<p></p>“...The ‘<mark class="term misspelled">mada<u>kh</u>il</mark><mark class="term correction">madá<u>kh</u>il</mark>’ is a cherished national institution in Persia, the exaction of which, in a myriad different forms, whose ingenuity is only
    equalled by their multiplicity, is the <a name="Page_xliv"></a>crowning interest and delight of a Persian’s existence. This remarkable word, for which Mr.
    Watson says there is no precise English equivalent, may be variously translated as commission, perquisite, douceur, consideration, pickings and stealings,
    profit, according to the immediate context in which it is employed. Roughly speaking, it signifies that balance of personal advantage, usually expressed in
    money form, which can be squeezed out of any and every transaction. A negotiation, in which two parties are involved as donor and recipient, as superior
    and subordinate, or even as equal contracting agents, cannot take place in Persia without the party who can be represented as the author or the favour or
    service claiming and receiving a definite cash return for what he has done or given. It may of course be said that human nature is much the same all the
    world over; that a similar system exists under a different name in our own or other countries, and that the philosophic critic will welcome in the Persian
    a man and a brother. To some extent this is true. But in no country that I have ever seen or heard of in the world, is the system so open, so shameless, or
    so universal as in Persia. So far from being limited to the sphere of domestic economy or to commercial transactions, it permeates every walk and inspires
    most of the actions of life. By its operation, generosity or gratuitous service may be said to have been erased in Persia from the category of social
    virtues, and cupidity has been elevated into the guiding principle of human conduct.... Hereby is instituted an arithmetical progression of plunder from
    the sovereign to the subject, each unit in the descending scale remunerating himself from the unit next in rank below him, and the hapless peasant being
    the ultimate victim. It is not surprising, under these circumstances, that office is the common avenue to wealth, and that cases are frequent of men who,
    having started from nothing, are found residing in magnificent houses, surrounded by crowds of retainers and living in princely style. <mark class="term unknown">‘Make</mark> what you can
    while you <mark class="term unknown">can’</mark> is the rule that most men set before themselves in entering public life. Nor does popular spirit resent the act; the estimation of any one
who, enjoying the opportunity, has failed to line his own pockets, being the reverse of complimentary to his sense. No one turns a thought to    <a name="Page_xlv"></a>the sufferers from whom, in the last resort, the material for these successive ‘<mark class="term misspelled">mada<u>kh</u>ils</mark><mark class="term correction">madá<u>kh</u>ils</mark>’ has been derived, and from the
    sweat of whose uncomplaining brow has been wrung the wealth that is dissipated in luxurious country houses, European curiosities, and enormous retinues.
<p></p>“...Among the features of public life in Persia that most quickly strike the stranger’s eye, and that indirectly arise from the same conditions, is the
    enormous number of attendants and retainers that swarm round a minister, or official of any description. In the case of a functionary of rank or position,
    these vary in number from 50 to 500. Benjamin says that the Prime Minister in his time kept 3,000. Now, the theory of social and ceremonial etiquette that
    prevails in Persia, and indeed throughout the East, is to some extent responsible for this phenomenon, personal importance being, to a large extent,
    estimated by the public show which it can make, and by the staff of servants whom on occasions it can parade. But it is the institution of <mark class="term unknown">‘Mada<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term unknown">il’</mark> and of illicit pickings and stealings that is the root of the evil. If the governor or minister were bound to pay salaries to the whole of this servile
    crew their ranks would speedily dwindle. The bulk of them are unpaid; they attach themselves to their master because of the opportunities for extortion
    with which that connection presents them, and they thrive and fatten on plunder. It may readily be conceived how great a drain is this swarm of
    <mark class="term unknown">blood-suckers</mark> upon the resources of the country. They are true types of unproductive labourers, absorbing but never creating wealth; and their existence is
    little short of a national calamity.... It is a cardinal point of Persian etiquette when you go out visiting to take as many of your own establishment with
    you as possible, whether riding or walking on foot; the number of such retinue being accepted as an indication of the rank of the master.”
<p></p><h4>D. THE ECCLESIASTICAL ORDER
</h4>“Marvellously adapted alike to the climate, character, and occupations of those countries upon which it has laid its adamantine grip, <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> holds its
votary in complete thrall from the cradle to the grave. To him, it is not only religion, it is government, philosophy, and science as well. The <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadan</mark><a name="Page_xlvi"></a>conception is not so much that of a state church as, if the phrase may be permitted, of a church state. The undergirders with which
    society itself is warped round are not of civil, but of ecclesiastical, fabrication; and, wrapped in this superb, if paralysing, creed, the Musulman lives
    in contented surrender of all volition, deems it his highest duty to worship God and to compel, or, where impossible, to despise those who do not worship
    Him in the spirit, and then dies in sure and certain hope of Paradise.
<p></p>“...These Siyyids, or descendants of the Prophet, are an intolerable nuisance to the country, deducing from their alleged descent and from the prerogative
    of the green turban, the right to an independence and insolence of bearing from which their countrymen, no less than foreigners, are made to suffer.
<p></p>“...As a community, the Persian Jews are sunk in great poverty and ignorance.... Throughout the Musulman countries of the East these unhappy people have
    been subjected to the persecution which custom has taught themselves, as well as the world, to regard as their normal lot. Usually compelled to live apart
    in a Ghetto, or separate quarter of the towns, they have from time immemorial suffered from disabilities of occupation, dress, and habits, which have
    marked them out as social pariahs from their <mark class="term unknown">fellow-creatures</mark>. ...In <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, where there are said to be 3,700, and where they occupy a relatively better
    status than elsewhere in Persia, they are not permitted to wear the ‘<mark class="term correct">kuláh</mark>’ or Persian <mark class="term unknown">head-dress</mark>, to have shops in the bazaar, to build the walls of their
    houses as high as a Muslim neighbour’s, or to ride in the streets.... As soon, however, as any outburst of bigotry takes place in Persia or elsewhere, the
    Jews are apt to be the first victims Every man’s hand is then against them; and woe betide the luckless Hebrew who is the first to encounter a Persian
    street mob.
<p></p>“...Perhaps the most extraordinary feature of <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark> life, before I leave the subject of the shrine and the pilgrims, is the provision that is made
    for the material solace of the letter during their stay in the city. In recognition of the long journeys which they have made, of the hardships which they
    have sustained, and of the distances by which they are <a name="Page_xlvii"></a>severed from family and home, they are permitted, with the connivance of
    the ecclesiastical law and its officers, to contract temporary marriages during their sojourn in the city. There is a large permanent population of wives
    suitable for the purpose. A <mark class="term correct">mullá</mark> is found, under whose sanction a contract is drawn up and formally sealed by both parties, a fee is paid, and the union
    is legally accomplished. After the lapse of a fortnight or a month, or whatever be the specified period, the contract terminates; the temporary husband
    returns to his own lares et penates in some distant clime, and the lady, after an enforced celibacy of fourteen <mark class="term unknown">days’</mark> duration, resumes her career of
    persevering matrimony. In other words, a gigantic system of prostitution, under the sanction of the Church, prevails in <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>. There is probably
    not a more immoral city in Asia; and I should be sorry to say how many of the unmurmuring pilgrims who traverse seas and lands to kiss the grating of the
    <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark>’s tomb are not also encouraged and consoled upon their march by the prospect of an agreeable holiday and what might be described in the English
    vernacular as <mark class="term unknown">‘a</mark> good spree.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><h4>CONCLUSION
    <br>“Before I quit the subject of the Persian law and its administration, let me add a few words upon the subject of penalties and prisons. Nothing is more
    shocking to the European reader, in pursuing his way through the <mark class="term unknown">crime-stained</mark> and bloody pages of Persian history during the last and, in a happily less
    degree, during the present century, than the record of savage punishments and abominable tortures, testifying alternately to the callousness of the brute
    and the ingenuity of the fiend. The Persian character has ever been fertile in device and indifferent to suffering; and in the field of judicial executions
    it has found ample scope for the exercise of both attainments. Up till quite a recent period, well within the borders of the present reign, condemned
    criminals have been crucified, blown from guns, buried alive, impaled, shod like horses, torn asunder by being bound to the heads of two trees bent
    together and then allowed to spring back to their natural position, converted into human torches, flayed while living. <a name="Page_xlviii"></a>“...Under a twofold governing system, such as that of which I have now completed the description—namely, an administration in which every actor is, in
    different aspects, both the briber and the bribed; and a judicial procedure, without either a law or a law court—it will readily be understood that
    confidence in the Government is not likely to exist, that there is no personal sense of duty or pride of honour, no mutual trust or <mark class="term unknown">co-operation</mark> (except in
    the service of <mark class="term unknown">ill-doing</mark>), no disgrace in exposure, no credit in virtue, above all no national spirit or patriotism. Those philosophers are right who argue
    that moral must precede material, and internal exterior, reform in Persia. It is useless to graft new shoots on to a stem whose own sap is exhausted or
    poisoned. We may give Persia roads and railroads; we may work her mines and exploit her resources; we may drill her army and clothe her artisans; but we
    shall not have brought her within the pale of civilised nations until we have got at the core of the people, and given a new and a radical twist to the
    national character and institutions. I have drawn this picture of Persian administration, which I believe to be true, in order that English readers may
    understand the system with which reformers, whether foreigners or natives, have to contend, and the iron wall of resistance, built up by all the most
    selfish instincts in human nature, that is opposed to progressive ideas. The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> himself, however genuine his desire for innovation, is to some
    extent enlisted on the side of this pernicious system, seeing that he owes to it his private fortune; while those who most loudly condemn it in private are
    not behind their fellows in outwardly bowing their heads in the temple of Rimmon. In every rank below the sovereign, the initiative is utterly wanting to
    start a rebellion against the tyranny of immemorial custom; and if a strong man like the present king can only tentatively undertake it, where is he who
    shall preach the crusade?”

</p></h4>EXTRACTS FROM THE <mark class="term unknown">KITÁB-ÍQÁN</mark><p></p><p>“Though young and tender of age, and though the Cause He revealed was contrary to the desire of all the peoples of the earth, both high and low, rich and
    poor, exalted and abased, king and subject, yet He arose and steadfastly proclaimed it. All have known and heard this. He feared no one; He was reckless of
    consequences. Could such a thing be made manifest except through the power of a Divine Revelation, and the potency of God’s invincible Will? By the
    righteousness of God! Were anyone to entertain so great a Revelation in his heart, the thought of such a declaration would alone confound him! Were the
    hearts of all men to be crowded into his heart, he would still hesitate to venture upon so awful an enterprise. He could achieve it only by the permission
    of God, only if the channel of his heart were to be linked with the Source of Divine grace, and his soul be assured of the unfailing sustenance of the
    Almighty. To what, We wonder, do they ascribe so great a daring? Do they accuse Him of madness as they accused the Prophets of old? Or do they maintain
    that His motive was none other than leadership and the acquisition of earthly riches?
</p>“Gracious God! In His Book, which He hath entitled <mark class="term misspelled">‘Qayyúmu’l-Asmá</mark><mark class="term correction">Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘</mark>—the first, the greatest, and mightiest of all books—He prophesied His own martyrdom.
    In it is this passage: <mark class="term unknown">‘O</mark> Thou Remnant of God! I have sacrificed myself wholly for Thee; I have accepted curses for Thy sake; and have yearned for naught
    but martyrdom in the path of Thy love. Sufficient Witness unto me is God, the Exalted, the Protector, the Ancient of Days!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“...Could the Revealer of such utterance be regarded as walking in any other way than the way of God, and as having yearned for aught else except His good
    pleasure? In this very verse there lieth concealed a breath of detachment for which, if it were breathed upon the world, all beings would renounce their
    life, and sacrifice their soul.
</p>“...And now consider how this <mark class="term correct">Sadrih</mark> of the <mark class="term misspelled">Ridván</mark><mark class="term correction">Riḍván</mark> of God hath, in the prime of youth, risen to proclaim the <a name="Page_l"></a>Cause of God. Behold,
    what steadfastness He, the Beauty of God, hath revealed! The whole world rose to hinder Him, yet it utterly failed! The more severe the persecution they
    inflicted on that <mark class="term correct">Sadrih</mark> of Blessedness, the more His fervour increased, and the brighter burned the flame of His love. All this is evident, and none
    disputeth its truth. Finally, He surrendered His soul, and winged His flight unto the realms above.
<p></p>“...No sooner had that eternal Beauty revealed Himself in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, in the year sixty, and rent asunder the veil of concealment, than the signs of the
    ascendancy, the might, the sovereignty, and power emanating from that Essence of Essences and Sea of Seas, were manifest in every land. So much so, that
    from every city there appeared the signs, the evidences, the tokens, and testimonies of that Divine Luminary. How many were those pure and kindly hearts
    which faithfully reflected the light of that eternal Sun! And how manifold the emanations of knowledge from that Ocean of Divine Wisdom which encompassed
    all beings! ln every city, all the divines and nobles rose to hinder and repress them, and girded up the loins of malice, of envy, and tyranny for their
    suppression. How great the number of those holy souls, those essences of justice, who, accused of tyranny, were put to death! And how many embodiments of
    purity, who showed forth naught but true knowledge and stainless deeds, suffered an agonising death! Notwithstanding all this, each of these holy beings,
    up to his last moment, breathed the name of God and soared in the realm of submission and resignation. Such was the potency and transmuting influence which
    He exercised over them, that they ceased to cherish any desire but His Will, and wedded their souls to His remembrance.
<p></p>“Reflect: Who in the world is able to manifest such transcendent power, such pervading influence? All these stainless hearts and sanctified souls have,
    with absolute resignation, responded to the summons of His decree. Instead of making complaint, they rendered thanks unto God, and, amidst the darkness of
    their anguish, they revealed naught but radiant acquiescence in His Will. It is well known how relentless was the hate, and how bitter the malice and
    enmity, entertained <a name="Page_li"></a>by all the peoples of the earth towards these Companions. The persecution and pain which they inflicted on these
    holy and spiritual beings were regarded by them as means unto salvation, prosperity, and everlasting success. Hath the world, since the days of Adam,
    witnessed such tumult, such violent commotion? Notwithstanding all the torture they suffered, and the manifold afflictions they endured, they became the
    object of universal opprobrium and execration. Methinks, patience was revealed only by virtue of their fortitude, and faithfulness itself was begotten by
    their deeds.
<p></p>“Do thou ponder these momentous happenings in thine heart, so that thou mayest apprehend the greatness of this Revelation, and perceive its stupendous
    glory.”
<p></p><h4>DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF <mark class="term unknown"><u>SH</u>Í’AH</mark> <mark class="term correct">ISLÁM</mark>
</h4>“The cardinal point wherein the <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>í’ahs</mark> (as well as the other sects included under the more general term of <mark class="term unknown">Imámites</mark>) differ from the <mark class="term unknown">Sunnís</mark> is the
    doctrine of the <mark class="term unknown">Imámate</mark>. According to the belief of the latter, the vicegerency of the Prophet (<u>Kh</u>ilafat) is a matter to be determined by the choice
    and election of his followers, and the visible head of the Musulman world is qualified for the lofty position which he holds less by any special divine
    grace than by a combination of orthodoxy and administrative capacity. According to the <mark class="term unknown">Imámite</mark> view, on the other hand, the vicegerency is a matter
    altogether spiritual; an office conferred by God alone, first by His Prophet, and afterwards by those who so succeeded him, and having nothing to do with
the popular choice or approval. In a word, the <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>alífih</mark> of the <mark class="term unknown">Sunnís</mark> is merely the outward and visible Defender of the Faith: the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> of the    <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>í’ahs</mark> is the divinely ordained successor of the Prophet, one endowed with all perfections and spiritual gifts, one whom all the faithful must
    obey, whose decision is absolute and final, whose wisdom is superhuman, and whose words are authoritative. The general term <mark class="term unknown">Imámate</mark> is applicable to all
    who hold this latter view without reference to the way in which they trace the succession, and therefore includes such sects as the <mark class="term correct">Báqirís</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled">Isma’ílís</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘ílís</mark>
    as well as the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>í‘ah</mark> or <a name="Page_lii"></a><mark class="term unknown">‘Church</mark> of the <mark class="term unknown">Twelve’</mark> (<mark class="term misspelled">Ma<u>dh</u>hab-i-I<u>th</u>na-‘A<u>sh</u>aríyyih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ma<u>dh</u>hab-i-I<u>th</u>ná-‘A<u>sh</u>aríyyih</mark>), as they are more

He bore not only the same name but the
    same <a name="Page_liii"></a><mark class="term correct">kunyih</mark>—<mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark>—as the Prophet, and according to the <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>í’ahs</mark> it is not lawful for any other to bear this name and

<p></p>“The <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>í’ahs</mark> hold that he did not die, but disappeared in an underground passage in <mark class="term misspelled">Surra-man-Ra’a</mark><mark class="term correction">Surra-man-Ra’á</mark>, A.H. 329; that he still lives, surrounded by a
    chosen band of his followers, in one of those mysterious cities, <mark class="term misspelled">Jabúlqá</mark><mark class="term correction">Jábulqá</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled">Jabúlsá</mark><mark class="term correction">Jábulsá</mark>; and that when the fulness of time is come, when the earth is filled
    with injustice, and the faithful are plunged in despair, he will come forth, heralded by Jesus Christ, overthrow the infidels, establish universal peace
    and justice, and inaugurate a millennium of blessedness. During the whole period of his <mark class="term unknown">Imámate</mark>, i.e. from A.H. 260 till the present day, the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark>
    has been invisible and inaccessible to the mass of his followers, and this is what is signified by the term ‘Occultation’ (<mark class="term correct"><u>Gh</u>aybat</mark>). After assuming
    the functions of <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> and presiding at the burial of his father and predecessor, the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ḥasan-i-’Askarí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥasan-i-‘Askarí</mark>, he disappeared from the sight of all save a
    chosen few, who, one after the other, continued to act as channels of communication between him and his followers. These persons were known as ‘Gates’

This period—extending over 69 years—during which
    the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> was still accessible by means of the <mark class="term unknown">‘Gates</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> is known as the ‘Lesser’ or <mark class="term unknown">‘Minor</mark><mark class="term unknown">Occultation’</mark> (<mark class="term misspelled"><u>Gh</u>aybat-i-Su<u>gh</u>ra</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Gh</u>aybat-i-Ṣu<u>gh</u>rá</mark>).

    by the ‘Greater’ or <mark class="term unknown">‘Major</mark><mark class="term unknown">Occultation’</mark> (<mark class="term correct"><u>Gh</u>aybat-i-Kubrá</mark>). When <mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Ḥasan</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, the last of the <mark class="term unknown">‘Gates</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> drew near to his latter end, he was urged
    by the faithful (who contemplated with despair the prospect of complete severance from the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark>) to nominate a successor. This, however, he refused to do,
    saying, <mark class="term unknown">‘God</mark> hath a purpose which He will accomplish.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> So on his death all <a name="Page_liv"></a>communication between the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> and his Church ceased, and
    the <mark class="term unknown">‘Major</mark><mark class="term unknown">Occultation’</mark> began and shall continue until the Return of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> take place in the fulness of time.” (Excerpt from “A Traveller’s Narrative,”

</p>THEORY AND ADMINISTRATION OF LAW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY“...The law in Persia, and, indeed, among Musulman peoples in general, consists of two branches: the religious, and the common law that which is based upon
    the <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadan</mark> Scriptures, and that which is based on precedent; that which is administered by ecclesiastical, and that which <a name="Page_lv"></a>is
    administered by civil tribunals. In Persia, the former is known as the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>ar’</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>ar‘</mark>, the latter as the <mark class="term correct">‘Urf</mark>. From the two is evolved a jurisprudence which,
    although in no sense scientific, is yet reasonably practical in application and is roughly accommodated to the needs and circumstances of those for whom it
    is dispensed. The basis of authority in the case of the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>ar’</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>ar‘</mark>, or Ecclesiastical Law, consists of the utterances of the Prophet in the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>; of
    the opinions of the Twelve Holy <mark class="term correct">Imáms</mark>, whose voice in the judgment of the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>í‘ah</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammadans</mark> is of scarcely inferior weight; and of the commentaries
    of a school of <mark class="term unknown">pre-eminent</mark> ecclesiastical jurists. The latter have played much the same part in adding to the volume of the national jurisprudence that the
    famous juris consulti did with the Common Law of Rome, or the Talmudic commentators with the Hebrew system. The body of law so framed has been roughly
    codified and divided into four heads, dealing respectively with religious rites and duties, with contracts and obligations, with personal affairs, and with
    sumptuary rules and judicial procedure. This law is administered by an ecclesiastical court, consisting of <mark class="term correct">mullás</mark>, i.e. lay priests and <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark>, i.e.
    learned doctors of the law, assisted sometimes by <mark class="term misspelled">qádís</mark><mark class="term correction">qáḍís</mark> or judges, and under the presidency of an official, known as the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>u’l-Islám</mark>, one
    of whom is, as a rule, appointed to every large city by the sovereign. In olden days, the chief of this ecclesiastical hierarchy was the <mark class="term misspelled">Sadru’s-Sudur</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣadru’ṣ-Ṣudúr</mark>, or
    Pontifex Maximus, a dignitary who was chosen by the king and placed over the entire priesthood and judicial bench of the kingdom. But this office was
    abolished in his <mark class="term unknown">anti-clerical</mark> campaign by <mark class="term misspelled">Nadir</mark><mark class="term correction">Nádir</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, and has never been renewed. In smaller centres of population and villages, the place of this
    court is taken by the local <mark class="term correct">mullá</mark> or <mark class="term correct">mullás</mark>, who, for a consideration, are always ready with a text from the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>. In the case of the higher courts, the
    decision is invariably written out, along with the citation from the Scriptures, or the commentators, upon which it is based. Cases of extreme importance
    are referred to the more eminent <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark>, of whom there is never a large number, who gain their position solely by eminent learning or abilities,
    ratified by the popular approval, and whose decisions are seldom impugned.... In works <a name="Page_lvi"></a>upon the theory of the law in Persia, it is
    commonly written that criminal cases are decided by the ecclesiastical, and civil cases by the secular, courts. In practice, however, there is no such
    clear distinction; the functions and the prerogative of the <mark class="term unknown">co-ordinate</mark> benches vary at different epochs, and appear to be a matter of accident or choice
    rather than of neCessity; and at the present time, though criminal cases of difficulty may be submitted to the ecclesiastical court, yet it is with civil
    matters that they are chiefly concerned. Questions of heresy or sacrilege are naturally referred to them; they also take cognisance of adultery and
    divorce; and intoxication as an offence, not against the common law (indeed, if it were a matter of precedent, insobriety could present the highest
    credentials in Persia), but against the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, falls within the scope of their judgment....
<p></p>“From the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>ar’</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>ar‘</mark>, I pass to the <mark class="term correct">‘Urf</mark>, or Common Law. Nominally this is based on oral tradition, on precedent, and on custom. As such, it varies in
    different parts of the country. But, there being no written or recognised code, it is found to vary still more in practice according to the character or
    caprice of the individual who administers it.... The administrators of the <mark class="term correct">‘Urf</mark> are the civil magistrates throughout the kingdom, there being no secular
court or bench of judges after the Western model. In a village the case will be brought before the <mark class="term correct">kad-<u>kh</u>udá</mark>, or headman; in a town before the <mark class="term unknown">darú</mark><u>gh</u>ih, or police magistrate. To their judgment are submitted all the petty offences that occupy a city <mark class="term unknown">police-court</mark> or a bench of country magistrates
    in England. The penalty in the case of larceny, or assault, or such like offences, is, as a rule, restitution, either in kind or in money value; while, if
    lack of means renders this impossible, the criminal is soundly thrashed. All ordinary criminal cases are brought before the <mark class="term misspelled">hakím</mark><mark class="term correction">ḥakím</mark>, or governor of a town;
    the more important before the provincial governor or <mark class="term unknown">governor-general</mark>. The ultimate court of appeal in each case is the king, of whose sovereign authority
    these subordinate exercises of jurisdiction are merely a delegation, although it is rare that a suppliant at any distance from the capital call make his
    complaint heard so far.... Justice, as dispensed in this fashion by the officers of government in Persia, obeys no law and follows <a name="Page_lvii"></a>no system. Publicity is the sole guarantee for fairness; but great is the scope, especially in the lower grades, for <mark class="term misspelled">pi<u>sh</u>ka<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">pí<u>sh</u>ka<u>sh</u></mark> and the bribe.
    The darugis have the reputation of being both harsh and venal, and there are some who go so far as to say that there is not a sentence of an official in
    Persia, even of the higher ranks, that cannot be swayed by a pecuniary consideration.”

<p></p>AT A time when the shining reality of the Faith of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> had been obscured by the ignorance, the fanaticism, and perversity of the contending sects into
which it had fallen, there appeared above the horizon of the East<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[§]</a> that luminous Star of Divine guidance,    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aḥmad-i-Ahsá’í</mark><mark class="term correction">Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í</mark>.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[**]</a> He observed how those who professed the Faith of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> had shattered
    its unity, sapped its force, perverted its purpose, and degraded its holy name. His soul was filled with anguish at the sight of the corruption and strife
    which characterised the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>í‘ah</mark> sect of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. Inspired by the light that shone within him,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[††]</a> he
    arose with unerring vision, with fixed purpose, and sublime detachment to utter his protest against the betrayal of the Faith by that ignoble people. Aglow
    with zeal and conscious of the sublimity of his calling, he vehemently appealed not only to <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark><mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> but to all the followers of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>
    throughout <a name="Page_2"></a>the East, to awaken from the slumber of negligence and to prepare the way for Him who must needs be made manifest in the
    fulness of time, whose light alone could dissipate the mists of prejudice and ignorance which had enveloped that Faith. Forsaking his home and kindred, on
    one of the islands of Bahrayn, to the south of the Persian Gulf, he set out, as bidden by an almighty Providence, to unravel the mysteries of those verses
    of <mark class="term misspelled">Islamic</mark><mark class="term correction">Islámic</mark> Scriptures which foreshadowed the advent of a new Manifestation. He was well aware of the dangers and perils that beset his path; he fully
    realised the crushing responsibility of his task. There burned in his soul the conviction that no reform, however drastic, within the Faith of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, could
    achieve the regeneration of this perverse people. He knew, and was destined by the Will of God to demonstrate, that nothing short of a new and independent
Revelation, as attested and foreshadowed by the sacred Scriptures of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, could revive the fortunes and restore the purity of that decadent Faith.    <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[‡‡]</a><p></p>Bereft of all earthly possessions, and detached from all save God, he, in the early days of the thirteenth century of the Hegira, when forty years of age,
arose to dedicate the remaining days of his life to the task he felt impelled to shoulder. He first proceeded to <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[§§]</a> where in a few years he acquired familiarity with the prevailing thoughts and standards current among
    the learned men of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. There he came to be recognised as one of the authorised expounders of the <mark class="term correct">Islámic</mark> Holy Writ, was declared a <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark>, and soon
    obtained an ascendancy over the rest of his colleagues, who either visited or were residing in those holy cities. These came to regard him as one initiated
    into the mysteries of Divine Revelation, and qualified to unravel the abstruse utterances of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> and of the <mark class="term correct">imáms</mark> of the Faith. As his influence
    increased, and the scope of his <a name="Page_3"></a>authority widened, he found himself besieged on every side by an <mark class="term unknown">ever-increasing</mark> number of devoted
    enquirers who asked to be enlightened regarding the intricacies of the Faith, all of which he ably and fully expounded. By his knowledge and fearlessness
    he struck terror to the hearts of the <mark class="term correct">Súfís</mark> and <mark class="term unknown">Neo-Platonists</mark> and other kindred schools of thought,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[***]</a> who
    envied his learning and feared his ruthlessness. Thereby he acquired added favour in the eyes of those learned divines, who looked upon these sects as the
    disseminators of obscure and heretical doctrines. Yet, great as was his fame and universal as was the esteem in which he was regarded, he despised all the
    honours which his admirers lavished upon him. He marvelled at their servile devotion to dignity and rank, and refused resolutely to associate himself with
    the objects of their pursuits and desires. <a name="Page_4"></a>Having achieved his purpose in those cities, and inhaling the fragrance which wafted upon him from Persia, he felt in his heart an irrepressible yearning
    to hasten to that country. He concealed from his friends, however, the real motive that impelled him to direct his steps towards that land. By way of the
Persian Gulf, he hastened unto the land of his heart’s desire, ostensibly for the purpose of visiting the shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[†††]</a> He was filled with eagerness to unburden his soul, and searched zealously for those to whom he could
    deliver the secret which to no one he had as yet divulged. Upon his arrival at <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, the city which enshrined that concealed Treasure of God, and
    from which the voice of the Herald of a new Manifestation was destined to be proclaimed, he repaired to the <mark class="term misspelled">Masjid-i-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Masjid-i-Jum‘ih</mark>, a mosque which in its style
    and shape bore a striking resemblance to the holy shrine of Mecca. Many a time did he, whilst gazing upon that edifice, observe: “Verily, this house of God
betokens such signs as only those who are endowed with understanding can perceive. Methinks he who conceived and built it was inspired of God.”    <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[‡‡‡]</a> How often and how passionately he extolled that city! Such was the praise he lavished upon it that
    his hearers, who were only too familiar with its mediocrity, were astonished at the tone of his language. “Wonder not,” he said to those who were
    surprised, “for ere long the secret of my words will be made manifest to you. Among <a name="Page_5"></a>you there shall be a number who will live to
    behold the glory of a Day which the prophets of old have yearned to witness.” So great was his authority in the eyes of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> who met and conversed
    with him, that they professed themselves incapable of comprehending the meaning of his mysterious allusions and ascribed their failure to their own
    deficient understanding.
<p></p>Having sown the seeds of Divine knowledge in the hearts of those whom he found receptive to his call, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> set out for <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>, where he
    tarried awhile, engaged continually in the dissemination of such truths as he felt urged to reveal. Most of his books and epistles were written in that
    city.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[§§§]</a> Such was the fame he acquired,<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[****]</a> that the
    ruler of Persia, <mark class="term correct">Fatḥ-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, was moved to address to him from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> a written message,<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[††††]</a>
    calling upon him to explain certain specific questions related to the abstruse teachings of the Muslim Faith, the meaning of which the leading <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of
his realm had been unable to unfold. To this he readily answered in the form of an epistle to which he gave the name of “<mark class="term unknown">Risaly-i-Sultaníyyih</mark>.” The    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> was so pleased with the tone and subject matter of that epistle that he forthwith sent him a second message, this time extending to him an
    invitation to visit his court. Replying to this second imperial message, <a name="Page_6"></a>Illustrations: <mark class="term correct">FATḤ-‘ALÍ</mark><mark class="term unknown"><u>SH</u>ÁH</mark> AND SONS] <a name="Page_7"></a>he wrote the following: “As I had intended ever since my departure from <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark> and
    <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> to visit and pay my homage to the shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, I venture to hope that your Imperial Majesty will graciously allow me
    to fulfil the vow which I have made. Later on, God willing, it is my hope and purpose to avail myself of the honour which your Imperial Majesty has deigned
    to confer upon me.
<p></p>Among those who, in the city of <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>, were awakened by the message of that bearer of the light of God, was <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>, a man of great piety,
    upright and <mark class="term unknown">God-fearing</mark>. He visited <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> each day in the company of a certain <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-<u>Kh</u>áliq-i-Yazdí</mark>, who was noted for
    his authority and learning. On certain occasions, however, in order to talk confidentially with <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, to the great
    surprise of the learned <mark class="term misspelled">‘Abdu’l-<u>Kh</u>aliq</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abdu’l-<u>Kh</u>áliq</mark>, would ask him to retire from his presence and leave him alone with his chosen and favoured disciple. This
    marked preference shown to so modest and illiterate a man as <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark> was a cause of great surprise to his companion, who was only too conscious of
    his own superiority and attainments. Later, however, when <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> had departed from <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>, <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark> retired from the society of men
    and came to be regarded as a <mark class="term misspelled">Súfí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣúfí</mark>. By the orthodox leaders of that community, however, such as the <mark class="term unknown">Ni’matu’lláh</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Dh</u>ahábí</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Dh</u>ahabí</mark>, he was denounced as an
    intruder and was suspected of a desire to rob them of their leadership. <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>, for whom the <mark class="term misspelled">Súfí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣúfí</mark> doctrine had no special attraction, scorned their
    false imputations and shunned their society. He associated with none except <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ḥasan-i-Nayiní</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥasan-i-Náyiní</mark>, whom he had chosen as his intimate friend and to whom he
    confided the secret with which he had been entrusted by his master. When <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark> died, this friend, following his example, continued to pursue the
    path which he had directed him to tread, and announced to every receptive soul the tidings of God’s <mark class="term unknown">fast-approaching</mark> Revelation. <a name="Page_8"></a><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Maḥmúd-i-Qamsarí</mark><mark class="term correction">Maḥmúd-i-Qamṣarí</mark>, whom I met in <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>, and who at that time was an old man over ninety years of age and was greatly beloved and revered by
    all those who knew him, related to me the following story: “I recall when in my youth, at the time when I was living in <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>, I heard of a certain
    man in <mark class="term misspelled">Nayin</mark><mark class="term correction">Náyin</mark> who had arisen to announce the tidings of a new Revelation, and under whose spell fell all who heard him, whether scholars, officials of the
    government, or the uneducated among the people. His influence was such that those who came in contact with him renounced the world and despised its riches.
    Curious to ascertain the truth, I proceeded, unsuspected by my friends, to <mark class="term misspelled">Nayin</mark><mark class="term correction">Náyin</mark>, where I was able to verify the statements that were current about him.
    His radiant countenance bespoke the light that had been kindled in his soul. I heard him, one day, after he had offered his morning prayer, speak words
    such as these: <mark class="term unknown">‘Ere</mark> long will the earth be turned into a paradise. Ere long will Persia be made the shrine round which will circle the peoples of the
earth.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> One morning, at the hour of dawn, I found him fallen upon his face, repeating in wrapt devotion the words <mark class="term misspelled">‘Alláh-u-Akbar</mark><mark class="term correction">Alláh-u-Akbar</mark>.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[‡‡‡‡]</a> To my great surprise he turned to me and said: <mark class="term unknown">‘That</mark> which I have been announcing to you is now
    revealed. At this very hour the light of the promised One has broken and is shedding illumination upon the world. O <mark class="term correct">Maḥmúd</mark>, verily I say, you shall live to
    behold that Day of days.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The words which that holy man addressed to me kept ringing in my ears until the day when, in the year sixty, I was privileged to
    hear the Call that arose from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. I was, alas, unable, because of my infirmities, to hasten to that city. Later, when the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, the herald of the
    new Revelation, arrived in <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark> and for three nights lived as a guest in the house of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Jání</mark>, I was unaware of His visit and so missed
    the honour of attaining His presence. Sometime afterwards, whilst conversing with the followers of the Faith, I was informed that the birthday of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>
    fell on the first day of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark> of the year 1235 A.H.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[§§§§]</a> I realised that the day to which
<mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ḥasan-i-Nayiní</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥasan-i-Náyiní</mark> had referred did not correspond with this date, that there was actually a difference of two years between them. This thought    <a name="Page_9"></a>sorely perplexed me. Long after, however, I met a certain <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Kamálu’d-Dín-i-Naráqí</mark>, who announced to me the Revelation of
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>, and who shared with me a number of verses from the ‘<mark class="term misspelled">Qasidiy-i-Varqa’iyyih</mark><mark class="term correction">Qaṣídiy-i-Varqá’íyyih</mark>’ as well as certain passages of the Persian and
    Arabic <mark class="term unknown">‘Hidden</mark> Words.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I was moved to the depths of my soul as I heard him recite those sacred words. The following I still vividly remember: <mark class="term unknown">‘O</mark> Son of
    Being! Thy heart is my home; sanctify it for my descent. Thy spirit is my place of revelation; cleanse it for my manifestation. O Son of Earth! Wouldst
    thou have me, seek none other than me; and wouldst thou gaze upon my beauty, close thine eyes to the world and all that is therein; for my will and the
    will of another than I, even as fire and water, cannot dwell together in one heart.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I asked him the date of the birth of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> dawn of the
    second day of <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he replied, <mark class="term unknown">‘of</mark> the year 1233 A.H.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[*****]</a> I immediately remembered the words of
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> and recalled the day on which they were spoken. Instinctively I fell prostrate on the ground and exclaimed: <mark class="term unknown">‘Glorified</mark> art Thou, O my God, for
having enabled me to attain unto this promised Day. If now I be called to Thee, I die content and assured.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” That very year, the year 1274 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[†††††]</a> that venerable and radiant soul yielded his spirit to God.
<p></p>This account which I heard from the lips of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Maḥmúd-i-Qamsarí</mark><mark class="term correction">Maḥmúd-i-Qamṣarí</mark> himself, and which is still current amongst the people, is assuredly a compelling
    evidence of the perspicacity of the late <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aḥmad-i-Ahsá’í</mark><mark class="term correction">Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í</mark> and bears eloquent testimony to the influence he exercised upon his immediate
    disciples. The promise he gave them was eventually fulfilled, and the mystery with which he fired their souls was unfolded in all its glory.
<p></p>During those days when <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> was preparing to depart from <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡]</a> that other luminary of Divine guidance, set out from his native province of <mark class="term correct">Gílán</mark> with the object
    of visiting <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, ere the <a name="Page_10"></a>latter undertook his pilgrimage to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. In the course of his first
    interview with him, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> spoke these words: “I welcome you, O my friend! How long and how eagerly have I waited for you to come and
    deliver me from the arrogance of this perverse people! I am oppressed by the shamelessness of their acts and the depravity of their character. <mark class="term unknown">‘Verily</mark>, We
    proposed to the heavens, and to the earth, and to the mountains, to receive the trust of God, but they refused the burden, and they feared to receive it.
    Man undertook to bear it; and he, verily, hath proved unjust, ignorant.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p>This <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> had already, from his early boyhood, shown signs of remarkable intellectual power and spiritual insight. He was unique among those of his
    own rank and age. At the age of eleven, he had committed to memory the whole of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>. At the age of fourteen, he had learned by heart a prodigious
    number of prayers and recognised traditions of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>. At the age of eighteen, he had composed a commentary on a verse of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> known as the
    <mark class="term misspelled">Ayatu’l-Kursí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áyatu’l-Kursí</mark>, which had excited the wonder and the admiration of the most learned of his day. His piety, the gentleness of his character, and his humility
    were such that all who knew him, whether young or old, were profoundly impressed.
</p>In the year 1231 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[§§§§§]</a> when only <mark class="term unknown">twenty-two</mark> years old, he, forsaking home, kindred, and friends,
    departed from <mark class="term correct">Gílán</mark>, intent upon attaining the presence of him who had so nobly arisen to announce the approaching dawn of a Divine Revelation. He had been
    in the company of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> for only a few weeks, when the latter, turning to him one day, addressed him in these words: “Remain in your
    house and cease attending my lectures. Such of my disciples as may feel perplexed will turn henceforth to you, and will seek to obtain from you directly
    whatsoever assistance they may require. You will, through the knowledge which the Lord your God has bestowed upon you, resolve their problems and
    tranquillise <a name="Page_11"></a>their hearts. By the power of your utterance you will help to revive the sorely neglected Faith of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, your
    illustrious ancestor.” These words addressed to <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> excited the resentment and kindled the envy of the prominent disciples of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, among whom figured <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-i-Mamaqání</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-i-Mámáqání</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-<u>Kh</u>áliq-i-Yazdí</mark>. So compelling was the dignity of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, however, and so
    remarkable were the evidences of his knowledge and wisdom, that these disciples were awed and felt compelled to submit.
<p></p><u>Sh</u>
    ay<u>kh</u><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, having thus committed his disciples to the care of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, left for <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. There he tarried awhile, in the close
    vicinity of the holy shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><a name="Page_12"></a><mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>. Within its precincts he pursued with undiminished zest the course of
    his labours. By resolving the intricacies that agitated the minds of the seekers, he continued to prepare the way for the advent of the coming
    Manifestation. In that city he became increasingly conscious that the Day which was to witness the birth of the promised One could not be far distant. The
    promised hour, he felt, was fast approaching. From the direction of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, in the province of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, he was able to perceive the first glimmerings that
    heralded the dawn of the promised Dispensation. To him the Revelation foreshadowed in these following traditional utterances was at hand: “Ere long shall
    ye behold the countenance of your Lord resplendent as the moon in its full glory. And yet, ye shall fail to unite in acknowledging His truth and embracing
    His Faith.” And “One of the most mighty signs that shall signalise the advent of the promised Hour is this: <mark class="term unknown">‘A</mark> woman shall give birth to One who shall be
    her Lord.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p><u>Sh</u>
ay<u>kh</u> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> therefore set his face towards <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> and, accompanied by <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> and a number of his distinguished disciples, proceeded to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. The    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> of Persia, being informed of the approach of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> to his capital, commanded the dignitaries and officials of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> to go
    out to meet him. He directed them to extend a cordial expression of welcome on his behalf. The distinguished visitor and his companions were royally
entertained by the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, who visited him in person and declared him to be “the glory of his nation and an ornament to his people.”<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">[******]</a> In those days, there was born a Child in an ancient and noble family of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title="">[††††††]</a> whose father was <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Abbás</mark>, better known as <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Buzurg</mark>, a favoured minister of the Crown. That
    Child was <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> At the hour of dawn, on the second day <a name="Page_13"></a>of <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark>, in
    the year 1233 A.H.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title="">[§§§§§§]</a> the world, unaware of its significance, witnessed the birth of Him who was
    destined to confer upon it such incalculable blessings. <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, who recognised in its full measure the meaning of this auspicious
    event, yearned to spend the remaining days of his life within the precincts of the court of this Divine, this <mark class="term unknown">new-born</mark> King. But this was not to be. His
    thirst unallayed, and his yearning unsatisfied, he felt compelled to submit to God’s irrevocable decree, and, turning his face away from the city of his
    Beloved, proceeded to <mark class="term misspelled">Kirman<u>sh</u>áh</mark> <mark class="term correction">Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh</mark>.
</p>The governor of <mark class="term misspelled">Kirman<u>sh</u>áh</mark><mark class="term correction">Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh</mark>, Prince <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s eldest son and the ablest member of his house, had already begged
permission of his Imperial Majesty to enable him to entertain and serve in person <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title="">[*******]</a> So favoured was the Prince in the eyes of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, that his request was immediately
    granted. Wholly resigned to his destiny, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> bade farewell to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. Ere his departure from that city, he breathed a prayer that
    this hidden Treasure of God, now born amongst his countrymen, might be preserved and cherished by them, that they might recognise the full measure of His
    blessedness and glory, and might be enabled to proclaim His excellence to all nations and peoples.
<p></p>Upon his arrival in <mark class="term misspelled">Kirman<u>sh</u>áh</mark><mark class="term correction">Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh</mark>, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> decided to select a number of the most receptive from among his <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark> disciples,
    and, by devoting his special attention to their enlightenment, to enable them to become the active supporters of the Cause of the promised Revelation. In
    the series of books and epistles which he undertook to write, among which figures his <mark class="term unknown">well-known</mark> work <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>arhu’z-Zíyárih</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>arḥu’z-Zíyárih</mark>, he extolled in clear and
    vivid language the virtues of the <mark class="term correct">imáms</mark> of the Faith, and laid special stress upon the allusions which they had made to the coming of the promised One. By
    his repeated references to <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, he meant, however, none other than the <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> who was yet to be revealed; and by his allusions to the <mark class="term unknown">ever-recurrent</mark>
    name <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, he intended not the <a name="Page_14"></a><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> who had been slain, but the <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> recently born. To those who questioned him regarding the signs
    that must needs herald the advent of the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>, he emphatically asserted the inevitableness of the promised Dispensation. In the very year the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was
    born, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> suffered the loss of his son, whose name was <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>. To his disciples who mourned his loss he spoke
    these words of comfort: “Grieve not, O my friends, for I have offered up my son, my own <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, as a sacrifice for the <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> whose advent we all await. To
    this end have I reared and prepared him.”
<p></p><p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, whose name was <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark>, was born in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, on the first of <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark>, in the year 1235 A.H. He was the descendant of a house renowned
    for its nobility, which traced its origin to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Himself. His father, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Riḍá</mark>, as well as His mother, were descendants of the Prophet,
    and belonged to families of recognised standing. The date of His birth confirmed the truth of the saying attributed to the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, the Commander of the
    Faithful: “I am two years younger than my Lord.” The mystery of this utterance, however, remained unrevealed except to those who sought and recognised the
    truth of the new Revelation. It was He, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, who, in His first, His most weighty and exalted Book, revealed this passage concerning <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>: “O
    Thou Remnant of God! I have sacrificed Myself wholly for Thee; I have consented to be cursed for Thy sake; and have yearned for naught but martyrdom in the
    path of Thy love. Sufficient witness unto Me is God, the Exalted, the Protector, the Ancient of Days!”
</p><p>While <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> was sojourning in <mark class="term misspelled">Kirman<u>sh</u>áh</mark> <mark class="term correction">Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh</mark>, he received so many evidences of ardent devotion from Prince <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> that
    on one occasion he was moved to refer to the Prince in such terms: “<mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark> I regard as my own son, though he be a descendant of <mark class="term correct">Fatḥ-‘Alí</mark>.” A
    considerable number of seekers and disciples thronged his house and eagerly attended his lectures. To none, however, did he feel inclined to show the
    consideration and affectionate regard which characterised his attitude towards <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. He seemed to have singled him out from among the multitude
    that crowded to see him, and to be preparing him to carry on with undiminished vigour his work after his death. One <a name="Page_15"></a>of his disciples,
    one day, questioned <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> concerning the Word which the promised One is expected to utter in the fulness of time, a Word so
    appallingly tremendous that the three hundred and thirteen chiefs and nobles of the earth would each and all flee in consternation as if overwhelmed by its
    stupendous weight. To him <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> replied: “How can you presume to sustain the weight of the Word which the chieftains of the earth are
    incapable of bearing? Seek not to gratify an impossible desire. Cease asking me this question, and beseech forgiveness from God.” That presumptuous
    questioner again pressed him to disclose the nature of that Word. At last <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> replied: “Were you to attain that Day, were you to be
    told to repudiate the guardianship of <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> and to denounce its validity, what would you say?” “God forbid!” he exclaimed. “Such things can never be. That
    such words should proceed out of the mouth of the promised One is to me inconceivable.” How grievous the mistake he made, and how pitiful his plight! His
    faith was weighed in the balance, and was found wanting, inasmuch as he failed to recognise that He who must needs be made manifest is endowed with that
    sovereign power which no man dare question. His is the right “to command whatsoever He willeth, and to decree that which He pleaseth.” Whoever hesitates,
    whoever, though it be for the twinkling of an eye or less, questions His authority, is deprived of His grace and is accounted of the fallen. And yet few,
    if any, among those who listened to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> in that city, and heard him unfold the mysteries of the allusions in the sacred Scriptures,
    were able to appreciate the significance of his utterances or to apprehend their purpose. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, his able and distinguished lieutenant, alone, could
    claim to have understood his meaning.
</p>After the death of Prince <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>,<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title="">[†††††††]</a><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, freed from the urgent
    solicitations of the Prince to extend his sojourn in <mark class="term misspelled">Kirman<u>sh</u>áh</mark><mark class="term correction">Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh</mark>, transferred his residence to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. Though to outward seeming he was circling
    round the shrine of the <mark class="term misspelled">Siyyidu’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>uhada’</mark><mark class="term correction">Siyyidu’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>uhadá’</mark>,<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, his heart, whilst he
    performed those rites, was set upon that true <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, the only object of his devotions. A host of <a name="Page_16"></a>the most distinguished <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> and
    <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> thronged to see him. Many began to envy his reputation, and a number sought to undermine his authority. However much they strove, they failed to
    shake his position of undoubted preeminence amongst the learned men of that city. Eventually that shining light was summoned to shed its radiance upon the
    holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Thither he journeyed, there he pursued with unstinted devotion his labours, and there he was laid to rest beneath the
    shadow of the Prophet’s sepulchre, for the understanding of whose Cause he had so faithfully laboured.
<p></p>Ere he departed from <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, he confided to <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, his chosen successor, the secret of his mission,    <a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title="">[§§§§§§§]</a> and instructed him to strive to kindle in every receptive heart the fire that had burned so
    brightly within him. However much <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> insisted on accompanying him as far as <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark>, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> refused to comply with his request.
    “You have no time to lose,” were the last words which he addressed to him. “Every fleeting hour should be fully and wisely utilised. You should gird up the
    loin of endeavour and strive day and night to rend asunder, by the grace of God and by the hand of wisdom and <mark class="term unknown">loving-kindness</mark>, those veils of heedlessness
    that have blinded the eyes of men. For verily I say, the Hour is drawing nigh, the Hour I have besought God to spare me from witnessing, for the earthquake
    of the Last Hour will be tremendous. You should pray to God to be spared the overpowering trials of that Day, for neither of us is capable of withstanding
    its sweeping force. Others, of greater endurance and power, have been destined to bear this stupendous weight, men whose hearts are sanctified from all
    earthly things, and whose strength is reinforced by the potency of His power.”
<p></p><p>Having spoken these words, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> bade him farewell, urged him to face valiantly the trials that must needs afflict him, and committed
    him to the care of God. <a name="Page_17"></a>In <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> devoted himself to the work initiated by his master, expounded his teachings,
    defended his Cause, and answered whatever questions perplexed the minds of his disciples. The vigour with which he prosecuted his task inflamed the
    animosity of the ignorant and envious. “For forty years,” they clamoured, “we have suffered the pretentious teachings of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> to be
    spread with no opposition whatever on our part. We no longer can tolerate similar pretensions on the part of his successor, who rejects the belief in the
    resurrection of the body, who repudiates the literal interpretation of the <mark class="term misspelled">‘Mi’ráj</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mi‘ráj</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title="">[********]</a> who regards
    the signs of the coming Day as allegorical, and who preaches a doctrine heretical in character and subversive of the best tenets of orthodox <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>.” The
    louder their clamour and protestations, the firmer grew the determination of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> to prosecute his mission and fulfil his trust. He addressed an
    epistle to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, wherein he set forth at length the calumnies that had been uttered against him, and acquainted him with the
    character and extent of their opposition. In it he ventured to enquire as to how long he was destined to submit to the unrelenting fanaticism of a stubborn
    and ignorant people, and prayed to be enlightened regarding the time when the promised One was to be made manifest. To this <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>
    replied: “Be assured of the grace of your God. Be not grieved at their doings. The mystery of this Cause must needs be made manifest, and the secret of
    this Message must needs be divulged.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title="">[††††††††]</a> I can say no more, I can appoint <a name="Page_18"></a>no

</p><p>How great, how very great, is His Cause, that even to so exalted a personage as <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> words such as these should have been addressed! This answer of    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> imparted solace and strength to the heart of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, who, with redoubled determination, continued to withstand the
    onslaught of an envious and insidious enemy.
</p><u>Sh</u>
    ay<u>kh</u><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> died soon after,<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title="">[§§§§§§§§]</a> in the year 1242 A.H., at the age of <mark class="term unknown">eighty-one</mark>, and was laid
    to rest in the cemetery of <mark class="term misspelled">Baqí’</mark><mark class="term correction">Baqí‘</mark>,<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title="">[*********]</a> in the close vicinity of the resting place of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> in the
    holy city of Medina. <a name="Page_19"></a>CHAPTER II: THE MISSION OF <mark class="term correct">SIYYID</mark><mark class="term unknown">KÁZIM-I-RA<u>SH</u>TÍ</mark>THE news of the passing of his beloved master brought unspeakable sorrow to the heart of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. Inspired by the verse of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, “Fain would
    they put out God’s light with their mouths; but God only desireth to perfect His light, albeit the infidels abhor it,” he arose with unswerving purpose to
    consummate the task with which <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> had entrusted him. He found himself, after the removal of so distinguished a protector, a victim
    of the slanderous tongue and unrelenting enmity of the people around him. They attacked his person, scorned his teachings, and reviled his name. At the
    instigation of a powerful and notorious <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark> leader, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ibráhím-i-Qazvíní</mark>, the enemies of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> leagued together, and determined to
    destroy him. Thereupon <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> conceived the plan of securing the support and good will of one of the most formidable and outstanding ecclesiastical
    dignitaries of Persia, the renowned <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct">Báqir-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark>, who lived in <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark> and whose authority extended far beyond the confines
    of that city. This friendship and sympathy, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> thought, would enable him to pursue untrammelled the course of his activities, and would
    considerably enhance the influence which he exercised over his disciples. “Would that one amongst you,” he was often heard to say to his followers, “could
    arise, and, with complete detachment, journeyto <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, and deliver this message from me to that learned <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>: <mark class="term unknown">‘Why</mark> is it that in the beginning you
    showed such marked consideration and affection for the late <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, and have now suddenly detached yourself from the body of his chosen
    disciples? Why is it that you have abandoned us to the mercy of our opponents?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Would that such a messenger, putting his trust in God, might arise to
    unravel whatever mysteries perplex the mind of that learned <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>, and dispel such doubts as might have alienated <a name="Page_20"></a>his sympathy.
    Would that he were able to obtain from him a solemn declaration testifying to the unquestioned authority of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, and to the truth
    and soundness of his teachings. Would that he also, after having secured such a testimony, might visit <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark> and there obtain a similar
    pronouncement from <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Askarí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Askarí</mark>, the foremost ecclesiastical leader in that holy city, and then, having completed his mission, might return in triumph to
    this place.” Again and again did <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> find opportunity to reiterate his appeal. None, however, ventured to respond to his call except a certain
    <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muhít-i-Kirmání</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥíṭ-i-Kirmání</mark>, who expressed readiness to undertake this mission. To him <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> replied: “Beware of touching the lion’s tail. Belittle not
the delicacy and difficulty of such a mission.” He then, turning his face towards his youthful disciple, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Bu<u>sh</u>rú’í</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Bábu’l-Báb</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title="">[†††††††††]</a> addressed him in these words: “Arise and perform this mission, for I declare you equal to this
    task. The Almighty will graciously assist you, and will crown your endeavours with success.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> joyously sprang to his feet, kissed the hem of his teacher’s garment, vowed his loyalty to him, and started forthwith on his journey. With
    complete severance and noble resolve, he set out to achieve his end. Arriving in <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, he sought immediately the presence of the learned <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>. Clad in
    mean attire, and laden with the dust of travel, he appeared, amidst the vast and richly apparelled company of the disciples of that distinguished leader,
    an insignificant and negligible figure. Unobserved and undaunted, he advanced to a place which faced the seat occupied by that renowned teacher. Summoning
    to his aid all the courage and confidence with which the instructions of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> had inspired him, he addressed <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> in these
    words: “Hearken, O <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>, to my words, for response to my plea will ensure the safety of the Faith of the Prophet of God, and refusal to consider my
    message will cause it grievous injury.” These bold and courageous words, uttered with directness and force, produced a surprising impression upon the
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>. He suddenly interrupted his discourse, and, ignoring his audience, listened with close attention <a name="Page_21"></a>to the message which this
    strange visitor had brought. His disciples, amazed at this extraordinary behaviour, rebuked this sudden intruder and denounced his presumptuous
    pretensions. With extreme politeness, in firm and dignified language, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> hinted at their discourtesy and shallowness, and expressed surprise at
    their arrogance and vainglory. The <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> was highly pleased with the demeanour and argument which the visitor so strikingly displayed. He deplored and
    apologised for the unseemly conduct of his own disciples. In order to compensate for their ingratitude, he extended every conceivable kindness to that
    youth, assured him of his support, and besought him to deliver his message. Thereupon, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> acquainted him with the nature and object of the
    mission with which he had been entrusted. To this the learned <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> replied: “As we in the beginning believed that both <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> were actuated by no desire except to advance the cause of knowledge and safeguard the sacred interests of the Faith, we felt prompted to
    extend to them our heartiest support and to extol their teachings. In later years, however, we have noticed so many conflicting statements and obscure and
    mysterious allusions in their writings, that we felt it advisable to keep silent for a time, and to refrain from either censure or applause.” To this <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> replied: “I cannot but deplore such silence on your part, for I firmly believe that it involves the loss of a splendid opportunity to advance the
    cause of Truth. It is for you to set forth specifically such passages in their writings as appear to you mysterious or inconsistent with the precepts of
    the Faith, and I will, with the aid of God, undertake to expound their true meaning.” The poise, the dignity and confidence, which characterised the
    behaviour of this unexpected messenger, greatly impressed <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark>. He begged him not to press the matter at this moment, but to wait
    until a later day, when, in private converse, he might acquaint him with his own doubts and misgivings. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, however, feeling that delay might
    prove harmful to the cause he had at heart, insisted upon an immediate conference with him about the weighty problems which he felt impelled and able to
    resolve. The <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> was moved to tears by the youthful enthusiasm, <a name="Page_22"></a>the sincerity and serene confidence to which the countenance of
    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> so admirably testified. He sent immediately for some of the works written by <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, and began to
    question <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> regarding those passages which had excited his disapproval and surprise. To each reference the messenger replied with characteristic
    vigour, with masterly knowledge and befitting modesty.
</p>He continued in this manner, in the presence of the assembled disciples, to expound the teachings of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, to
    vindicate their truth, and to defend their cause, until the time when the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’a<u>dhdh</u>in</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu’a<u>dh</u><u>dh</u>in</mark>, calling the faithful to prayer, suddenly interrupted the flow
    of his argument. The next day, he similarly, in the presence of a large and representative assembly, and whilst facing the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>, resumed his eloquent
    defence of the high mission entrusted by an almighty Providence to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and his successor. A deep silence fell upon his hearers. They
    were seized with wonder at the cogency of his argument and the tone an manner of his speech. The <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> publicly promised that on the following day he
    would himself issue a written declaration wherein he would testify to the eminence of the position held by both <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, and would pronounce whosoever deviated from their path as one who had turned aside from the Faith of the Prophet Himself. He would likewise bear
    witness to their penetrative insight, and their correct and profound understanding of the mysteries which the Faith of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> enshrined. The <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>
    redeemed his pledge, and with his own hand penned the promised declaration. He wrote at length, and in the course of his testimony paid a tribute to the
    character and learning of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. He spoke in glowing terms of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, apologised for his former attitude, and expressed the hope that in the
    days to come he might be enabled to make amends for his past and regrettable conduct towards him. He read, himself, to his disciples the text of this
    written testimony, and delivered it unsealed to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, authorising him to share its contents with whomsoever he pleased, that all might know the
    extent of his devotion to <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>.
<p></p>No sooner had <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> retired than the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> charged one of his trusted attendants to follow in the footsteps <a name="Page_23"></a>of the visitor
and find out the place where he was residing. The attendant followed him to a modest building, which served as a <mark class="term correct">madrisih</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> and saw him enter a room which, except for a <mark class="term unknown">worn-out</mark> mat which covered its floor, was devoid
of furniture. He watched him arrive, offer his prayer of thanksgiving to God, and lie down upon that mat with nothing to cover him except his <mark class="term correct">‘abá</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title="">[§§§§§§§§§]</a> Having reported to his master all that he had observed, the attendant was again instructed to
    deliver to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> the sum of a hundred <mark class="term misspelled">túmans</mark><mark class="term correction">túmáns</mark>,<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title="">[**********]</a> and to express the sincere apologies of
    his master for his inability to extend to so remarkable a messenger a hospitality that befitted his station. To this offer <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> sent the following
    reply: “Tell your master that his real gift to me is the spirit of fairness with which he received me, and the <mark class="term unknown">open-mindedness</mark> which prompted him, despite
    his exalted rank, to respond to the message which I, a lowly stranger, brought him. Return this money to your master, for I, as a messenger, ask for
neither recompense nor reward. <mark class="term unknown">‘We</mark> nourish your souls for the sake of God; we seek from you neither recompense nor thanks.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title="">[††††††††††]</a> My prayer for your master is that earthly leadership may never hinder him from acknowledging
    and testifying to the Truth.”<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> died before the year sixty A.H., the
    year that witnessed the birth of the Faith proclaimed by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. <a name="Page_24"></a>He remained to his last moment a staunch supporter and fervent
    admirer of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>.
<p></p>Having fulfilled the first part of his mission, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> despatched this written testimony of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> to his master in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, and
    directed his steps towards <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, determined to deliver, to the best of his ability the message which he was charged to give to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Askarí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Askarí</mark>.
    Immediately the letter, enclosing the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>’s written declaration, was delivered to <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, the latter was so rejoiced that he forthwith sent to
    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> his reply, expressing his grateful appreciation of the exemplary manner in which he had discharged his trust. He was so delighted with the
    answer he had received that, interrupting the course of his lecture, he read out, to his disciples, both the letter of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and the written
    testimony enclosed in that letter. He afterwards shared with them the epistle which he himself had written to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> in recognition of the remarkable
    service he had rendered him. In it <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> paid such a glowing tribute to his high attainments, to his ability and character that a few among those
    who heard it suspected that <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was that promised One to whom their master unceasingly referred, the One whom he so often declared to be living in
    their very midst and yet to have remained unrecognised by them all. That communication enjoined upon <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> the fear of God, urged him to regard it
    as the most potent instrument with which to withstand the onslaught of the enemy, and the distinguishing feature of every true follower of the Faith. It
    was couched in such terms of tender affection, that no one who read it could doubt that the writer was bidding farewell to his beloved disciple, and that
    he entertained no hope of ever meeting him again in this world.
<p></p>In those days <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> became increasingly aware of the approach of the Hour at which the promised One was to be revealed.    <a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§]</a> He realised how dense were those veils that <a name="Page_25"></a>hindered the seekers from
    apprehending the glory of the concealed Manifestation. He accordingly exerted his utmost endeavour to remove gradually, with caution and wisdom, whatever
    barriers might stand in the way of the full recognition of that Hidden Treasure of God. He repeatedly urged his disciples to bear in mind the fact that He
    whose advent they were expecting would appear neither from <mark class="term misspelled">Jabúlqá</mark><mark class="term correction">Jábulqá</mark> nor from <mark class="term misspelled">Jabúlsá</mark><mark class="term correction">Jábulsá</mark>.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title="">[***********]</a> He even
    hinted at His presence in their very midst. “You behold Him with your own eyes,” he often observed, “and yet recognise Him not!” To his disciples who
    questioned him regarding the signs of the Manifestation, he would say: “He is of noble lineage. He is a descendant of the Prophet of God, of the family of
    <mark class="term correct">Há<u>sh</u>im</mark>. He is young in age, and is possessed of innate knowledge. His learning is derived, not from the teachings of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, but
    from God. My knowledge is but a drop compared with the immensity of His knowledge; my attainments a speck of dust in the face of the wonders of His grace
and power. Nay, immeasurable is the difference. He is of medium height, abstains from smoking, and is of extreme devoutness and piety.”    <a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title="">[†††††††††††]</a> Certain of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>’s disciples, despite the testimonies of their master, believed him to
    be the promised One, for in him they recognised the signs to which he was alluding. Among them was a certain <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Mihdíy-i-<u>Kh</u>ú’í</mark><mark class="term correction">Mihdíy-i-<u>Kh</u>u’í</mark>, who went so far
    as to make public this belief. Whereupon the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> was sore displeased, and would have cast him out from the company of his chosen followers had he not
    begged forgiveness and expressed his repentance for his action.
<p></p><u>Sh</u>
    ay<u>kh</u><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Zunúzí</mark>, himself, informed me that he too entertained such doubts, that he prayed to God that if his supposition was well founded he
    should be confirmed in his belief, and if not that he should be delivered from such idle fancy. “I was so perturbed,” he once related to me, “that for days
    I could neither eat nor sleep. My days were spent in the service of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, to whom I was greatly attached. One day, at the hour of dawn, I was
    suddenly <a name="Page_26"></a>awakened by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Naw-rúz</mark>, one of his intimate attendants, who, in great excitement, bade me arise and follow him. We went
    to the house of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, where we found him fully dressed, wearing his <mark class="term correct">‘abá</mark>, and ready to leave his home. He asked me to accompany him. <mark class="term unknown">‘A</mark> highly
    esteemed and distinguished Person,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he said, <mark class="term unknown">‘has</mark> arrived. I feel it incumbent upon us both to visit Him.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The morning light had just broken when I found
    myself walking with him through the streets of <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. We soon reached a house, at the door of which stood a Youth, as if expectant to receive us. He wore
    a green turban, and His countenance revealed an expression of humility and kindliness which I can never describe. He quietly approached us, extended His
    arms towards <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, and lovingly embraced him. His affability and <mark class="term unknown">loving-kindness</mark> singularly contrasted with the sense of profound reverence that
    characterised the attitude of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> towards him. Speechless and with bowed head, he received the many expressions of affection and esteem with which
    that Youth greeted him. We were soon led by Him to the upper floor of that house, and entered a chamber bedecked with flowers and redolent of the loveliest
    perfume. He bade us <a name="Page_27"></a>be seated. We knew not, however, what seats we actually occupied, so overpowering was the sense of delight which
    seized us. We observed a silver cup which had been placed in the centre of the room, which our youthful Host, soon after we were seated, filled to
overflowing, and handed to <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, saying: <mark class="term unknown">‘A</mark> drink of a pure beverage shall their Lord give them.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> held the cup with both hands and quaffed it. A feeling of reverent joy filled
    his being, a feeling which he could not suppress. I too was presented with a cupful of that beverage, though no words were addressed to me. All that was
    spoken at that memorable gathering was the <mark class="term unknown">above-mentioned</mark> verse of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>. Soon after, the Host arose from His seat and, accompanying us to the
    threshold of the house, bade us farewell. I was mute with wonder, and knew not how to express the cordiality of His welcome, the dignity of His bearing,
    the charm of that face, and the delicious fragrance of that beverage. How great was my amazement when I saw my teacher quaff without the least hesitation
    that holy draught from a silver cup, the use of which, according to the precepts of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, is forbidden to the faithful. I could not explain the motive
    which could have induced the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> to manifest such profound reverence in the presence of that Youth—a reverence which even the sight of the shrine of the
    <mark class="term misspelled">Siyyidu’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>uhada’</mark><mark class="term correction">Siyyidu’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>uhadá’</mark> had failed to excite. Three days later, I saw that same Youth arrive and take His seat in the midst of the company of the
    assembled disciples of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. He sat close to the threshold, and with the same modesty and dignity of bearing listened to the discourse of the
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>. As soon as his eyes fell upon that Youth, the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> discontinued his address and held his peace. Whereupon one of his disciples begged him to
    resume the argument which he had left unfinished. <mark class="term unknown">‘What</mark> more shall I say?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> replied <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, as he turned his face toward the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. <mark class="term unknown">‘Lo</mark>, the Truth is
    more manifest than the ray of light that has fallen upon that lap!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I immediately observed that the ray to which the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> referred had fallen upon the
lap of that same Youth whom we had recently visited. <mark class="term unknown">‘Why</mark> is it,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> that questioner enquired, <mark class="term unknown">‘that</mark> you neither reveal His name nor identify His    <a name="Page_28"></a>person?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> To this the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> replied by pointing with his finger to his own throat, implying that were he to divulge His name, they
    both would be put to death instantly. This added still further to my perplexity. I had already heard my teacher observe that so great is the perversity of
    this generation, that were he to point with his finger to the promised One and say: <mark class="term unknown">‘He</mark> indeed is the Beloved, the Desire of your hearts and mine,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> they
    would still fail to recognise and acknowledge Him. I saw the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> actually point out with his finger the ray of light that had fallen on that lap, and
    yet none among those who were present seemed to apprehend <a name="Page_29"></a>its meaning. I, for my part, was convinced that the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> himself could
    never be the promised One, but that a mystery inscrutable to us all, lay concealed in that strange and attractive Youth. Several times I ventured to
    approach <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> and seek from him an elucidation of this mystery. Every time I approached him, I was overcome by a sense of awe which his personality
    so powerfully inspired. Many a time I heard him remark: <mark class="term unknown">‘O</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, rejoice that your name is <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> [praiseworthy]; <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> your
beginning, and <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> your end. You have been privileged to attain to the day of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, you have been closely associated    <a name="Page_30"></a>with me, and in the days to come yours shall be the inestimable joy of beholding “what eye hath seen not, ear heard not, nor any
    heart conceived.”<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“I often felt the urge to seek alone the presence of that <mark class="term correct">Há<u>sh</u>imite</mark> Youth and to endeavour to fathom His mystery. I watched Him several times as He
    stood in an attitude of prayer at the doorway of the shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. So wrapt was He in His devotions that He seemed utterly oblivious of those
    around Him. Tears rained from His eyes, and from His lips fell words of glorification and praise of such power and beauty as even the noblest passages of
    our Sacred Scriptures could not hope to surpass. The words <mark class="term unknown">‘O</mark> God, my God, my Beloved, my heart’s <mark class="term unknown">Desire’</mark> were uttered with a frequency and ardour that
    those of the visiting pilgrims who were near enough to hear Him instinctively interrupted the course of their devotions, and marvelled at the evidences of
    piety and veneration which that youthful countenance evinced. Like Him they were moved to tears, and from Him they learned the lesson of true adoration.
    Having completed His prayers, that Youth, without crossing the threshold of the shrine and without attempting to address any words to those around Him,
    would quietly return to His home. I felt the impulse to address Him, but every time I ventured an approach, a force that I could neither explain nor
    resist, detained me. My enquiries about Him elicited the information that He was a resident of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, that He was a merchant by profession, and did
not belong to any of the ecclesiastical orders. I was, moreover, informed that He, and also His uncles and relatives, were among the lovers and admirers of    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. Soon after, I learned that He had departed for <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark> on His way to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. That Youth had set my heart
    aflame. The memory of that vision haunted me. My soul was wedded to His till the day when the call of a Youth from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, proclaiming Himself to be
    the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, reached my ears. The thought instantly flashed through my mind that such a person could be none other than that selfsame Youth whom I had seen in
    <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, the Youth of my heart’s desire.
</p>“When later on I journeyed from <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, I found that He had set out on a pilgrimage to Mecca and <a name="Page_31"></a>Medina. I met Him
    on His return and endeavoured, despite the many obstacles in my way, to remain in close association with Him. When subsequently He was incarcerated in the
    fortress of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>, in the province of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>, I was engaged in transcribing the verses which He dictated to His amanuensis. Every night, for a
period of nine months, during which He was a prisoner in that fort, He revealed, after He had offered His evening prayer, a commentary on a <mark class="term unknown">juz’</mark><a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>. At the end of each month a commentary on the whole of that sacred Book was
    thus completed. During His incarceration in <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>, nine commentaries on the whole of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> had been revealed by Him. The texts of these commentaries
    were entrusted, in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, to the keeping of a certain <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ibráhím-i-<u>Kh</u>alíl</mark>, who was instructed to conceal them until the time for their
    publication might arrive. Their fate is unknown until now.
<p></p>“In connection with one of these commentaries, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> one day asked me: <mark class="term unknown">‘Which</mark> do you prefer, this commentary which I have revealed, or the
    <mark class="term misspelled">Ahsánu’l-Qisás</mark><mark class="term correction">Aḥsanu’l-Qiṣaṣ</mark>, My previous commentary on the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of Joseph? Which of the two is superior, in your estimation?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘To</mark> me,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I replied, <mark class="term unknown">‘the</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ahsánu’l-Qisás</mark><mark class="term correction">Aḥsanu’l-Qiṣaṣ</mark>
    seems to be endowed with greater power and charm.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He smiled at my observation and said: <mark class="term unknown">‘You</mark> are as yet unfamiliar with the tone and tenor of this later
    commentary. The truths enshrined in this will more speedily and effectively enable the seeker to attain the object of his quest.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“I continued to be closely associated with Him until that great encounter of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. When informed of that event, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> directed
    all His companions to hasten to that spot, and extend every assistance in their power to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, His heroic and distinguished disciple. Addressing me one
    day, He said: <mark class="term unknown">‘But</mark> for My incarceration in the <mark class="term misspelled">Jabál-i-<u>Sh</u>adíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Jabal-i-<u>Sh</u>adíd</mark>, the fortress of <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, it would have been incumbent upon Me to lend My
    personal assistance to My beloved <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>. Participation in that struggle is not enjoined upon you. You should proceed to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> and should abide in that
    holy city, inasmuch as you are destined to behold, with your own eyes, the beauteous countenance of the promised <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. As you gaze upon that radiant
    face, do also remember <a name="Page_32"></a>Me. Convey to Him the expression of My loving devotion.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He again emphatically added these words: <mark class="term unknown">‘Verily</mark> I
    say, I have entrusted you with a great mission. Beware lest your heart grow faint, lest you forget the glory with which I have invested you.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
</p><p>“Soon after, I journeyed to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> and lived, as bidden, in that holy city. Fearing that my prolonged stay in that centre of pilgrimage might excite
    suspicion, I decided to marry. I started to earn my livelihood as a scribe. What afflictions befell me at the hands of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ís</mark>, those
    who professed to be the followers of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and yet failed to recognise the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>! Mindful of the counsels of that beloved Youth, I
    patiently submitted to the indignities inflicted upon me. For two years I lived in that city. Meanwhile that holy Youth was released from His earthly
    prison and, through His martyrdom, was delivered from the atrocious cruelties that had beset the closing years of His life.
</p>“Sixteen lunar months, less twenty and two days, had elapsed since the day of the martyrdom of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, when, on the day of <mark class="term misspelled">Árafih</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Arafih</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title="">[************]</a> in the year 1267 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title="">[††††††††††††]</a> while I
    was passing by the gate of the inner courtyard of the shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, my eyes, for the first time, fell upon <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. What shall I recount
    regarding the countenance which I beheld! The beauty of that face, those exquisite features which no pen or brush dare describe, His penetrating glance,
    His kindly face, the majesty of His bearing, the sweetness of His smile, the luxuriance of His <mark class="term unknown">jet-black</mark> flowing locks, left an indelible impression upon
    my soul. I was then an old man, bowed with age. How lovingly He advanced towards me! He took me by the hand and, in a tone which at once betrayed power and
    beauty, addressed me in these words: <mark class="term unknown">‘This</mark> very day I have purposed to make you known as a <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> throughout <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Still holding my hand in His, He
    continued to converse with me. He walked with me all along the <mark class="term unknown">market-street</mark>, and in the end He said: <mark class="term unknown">‘Praise</mark> be to God that you have remained in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>,
and have beheld with your own eyes the countenance of the promised <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I recalled instantly the promise which had been given me by    <a name="Page_33"></a>the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. His words, which I had regarded as referring to a remote future, I had not shared with anyone. These words of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>
    moved me to the depths of my being. I felt impelled to proclaim to a heedless people, at that very moment and with all my soul and power, the advent of the
    promised <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. He bade me, however, repress my feelings and conceal my emotions. <mark class="term unknown">‘Not</mark> yet,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He breathed into my ears; <mark class="term unknown">‘the</mark> appointed Hour is approaching.
    It has not yet struck. Rest assured and be patient.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> From that moment all my sorrows vanished. My soul was flooded with joy. In those days I was so poor
    that most of the time I hungered for food. I felt so rich, however, that all the treasures of the earth melted away into nothingness when compared with
    that which I already possessed. <mark class="term unknown">‘Such</mark> is the grace of God; to whom He will, He giveth it: He, verily, is of immense bounty.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p>I now return, after this digression, to my theme. I had been referring to the eagerness with which <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> had determined to rend asunder those veils
which intervened between the people of his day and the recognition of the promised Manifestation. In the introductory pages of his works, entitled    <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>arh-i-Qasidih</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>arḥ-i-Qaṣídih</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>arh-i-<u>Kh</u>utbih</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>arḥ-i-<u>Kh</u>uṭbih</mark>,<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> he, in veiled language, alludes to
    the blessed name of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. In a booklet, the last he wrote, he explicitly mentions the name of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> by his reference to the term “<u>Dh</u>
    <mark class="term unknown">ikru’lláh-i-‘Aẓam</mark>.” In it he writes: “Addressing this noble <mark class="term misspelled">‘<u>Dh</u>ikr</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Dh</u>ikr</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> this mighty voice
    of God, I say: <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> am apprehensive of the people, lest they harm you. I am apprehensive of my own self, lest I too may hurt you. I fear you, I tremble at
    your authority, I dread the age in which you live. Were I to treasure you <a name="Page_34"></a>as the apple of my eye until the Day of Resurrection, I
    would not sufficiently have proved my devotion to you.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title="">[*************]</a>How grievously <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> suffered at the hands of the people of wickedness! What harm that villainous generation inflicted upon him! For years he
    suffered silently, and endured with heroic patience all the indignities, the calumnies, the denunciations that were heaped upon him. He was destined,
    however, to witness, during the last years of his life, how the avenging hand of God “destroyed with utter destruction” those that opposed, vilified, and
    plotted against him. In those days the followers of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ibráhím</mark>, that notorious enemy of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, banded themselves together for the purpose of
    stirring up sedition and mischief and endangering the life of their formidable adversary. By every means at their disposal, they sought to poison the minds
    of his admirers and friends, to undermine his authority, and to discredit his name. No voice was raised in protest against the agitation that was being
    sedulously prepared by that ungodly and treacherous people, each of whom professed to be the exponent of true learning and the repository of the mysteries
    of the <a name="Page_35"></a>Faith of God. No one sought to warn or awaken them. They gathered such force and kindled such strife that they succeeded in
    evicting from <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, in a disgraceful manner, the representative official of the Ottoman government, and appropriated for their own sordid aims whatever
    revenues accrued to him. Their menacing attitude aroused the central government at Constantinople, which despatched a military official to the scene of
    agitation, with full instructions to quench the fires of mischief. With the force at his command, that official besieged the city, and despatched a
    communication to <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> in which he entreated him to pacify the minds of the excited populace. He appealed to him to counsel moderation to its
    inhabitants, to induce them to relax their stubbornness, and to surrender voluntarily to his rule. Were they to heed his counsels, he promised that he
    would undertake to ensure their safety and protection, would proclaim a general amnesty, and would strive to promote their welfare. If they refused,
    however, to submit, he warned them that their lives would be in danger, that a great calamity would surely befall them.
</p>Upon the receipt of this formal communication, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> summoned to his presence the chief instigators of the movement, and, with the utmost wisdom and
    affection, exhorted them to cease their agitation and surrender their arms. He spoke with such persuasive eloquence, such sincerity and detachment, that
    their hearts were softened and their resistance was subdued. They solemnly undertook to throw open, the next morning, the gates of the citadel and to
    present themselves, in the company of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, to the officer in command of the besieging forces. It was agreed that the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> would intervene in
    their behalf, and secure for them whatever would ensure their tranquillity and welfare. No sooner had they left the presence of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> than the
    <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark>, the chief instigators of the rebellion, unanimously arose to frustrate this plan. Fully aware that such intervention on the part of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>,
    who had already excited their envy, would serve to enhance his prestige and consolidate his authority, they determined to persuade a number among the
    foolish and excitable elements of the population to sally forth at night and attack the forces of the enemy. They assured <a name="Page_36"></a>them of
    victory on the strength of a dream in which one of their members had seen <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás</mark>,<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title="">[†††††††††††††]</a> who had
    charged him to incite his followers to wage holy war against the besiegers and had given him the promise of ultimate success.
<p></p>Deluded by this vain promise, they rejected the advice tendered by that wise and judicious counsellor, and arose to execute the designs of their foolish
    leaders. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, who was well aware of the evil influence that actuated that revolt, addressed a detailed and faithful report on the situation to the
    Turkish commander, who again wrote to <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> and reiterated his appeal for a peaceful settlement of the issue. He, moreover, declared that at a given
    time he would force the gates of the citadel, and would regard the home of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> as the only place of refuge for a defeated enemy. This declaration
    the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> caused to be spread throughout the city. It served only to excite the derision and contempt of the population. When informed of the reception
accorded that declaration, the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> remarked: “Verily, that with which they are threatened is for the morning. Is not the morning near?”    <a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><p></p>At daybreak, the appointed hour, the forces of the enemy bombarded the ramparts of the citadel, demolished its walls, entered the city, and pillaged and
    massacred a considerable number of its population. Many fled in consternation to the courtyard of the shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. Others sought refuge in
    the sanctuary of <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás</mark>. Those who loved and honoured <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> betook themselves to his home. So great was the crowd that hastened to the shelter of his
    residence, that it was found necessary to appropriate a number of the adjoining houses in order to accommodate the multitude of refugees who pressed at his
    doors. So vast and excited was the concourse that thronged his house, that when once the tumult had subsided, it was ascertained that no less than
    <mark class="term unknown">twenty-two</mark> persons had been trampled to death.
<p></p>What consternation seized the residents and visitors of the holy city! With what severity did the victors treat their terrified enemy! With what audacity
they ignored those sacred rights and prerogatives with which the piety of countless Muslim pilgrims had invested the holy sites of <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>!    <a name="Page_37"></a>They refused to recognise alike the shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and the sacred mausoleum of <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás</mark> as inviolable sanctuaries for the
    thousands who fled before the avenging wrath of an alien people. The hallowed precincts of both these shrines ran with the blood of the victims. One place,
    and only one, could assert its right of sanctuary to the innocent and faithful among the population. That place was the residence of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. His
    house, with its dependencies, was regarded as being endowed with such sanctity as even the most hallowed shrine of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark><mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> had failed to
    retain. That strange manifestation of the avenging wrath of God was an object lesson to those who were inclined to belittle the station of that holy man.
That memorable event<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> happened on the eighth of <mark class="term correct"><u>Dh</u>i’l-Hijjih</mark> in the year 1258 A.H.    <a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title="">[**************]</a>It is admittedly evident that in every age and dispensation those whose mission it is either to proclaim the Truth or to prepare the way for its
    acceptance, have invariably been opposed by a number of powerful adversaries, who challenged their authority and attempted to pervert their teachings.
    These have, either by fraud or pretence, calumny or oppression, succeeded for a time in beguiling the uninformed and in <a name="Page_38"></a>misleading
    the feeble. Desirous of maintaining their hold over the thoughts and consciences of men, they have, so long as the Faith of God remained concealed, been
    able to enjoy the fruits of a fleeting and precarious ascendancy. No sooner was the Faith proclaimed, however, than they found, to their utter dismay, the
    effects of their dark plottings pale before the dawning light of the new Day of God. Before the fierce rays of that rising Orb all their machinations and
    evil deeds faded into nothingness and were soon a thing forgotten.
<p></p>Around <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> were likewise gathered a number of vain and ignoble people who feigned devotion and attachment to his person; who professed to be
    devout and pious, and who claimed to be the sole repositories of the mysteries enshrined in the utterances of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and his successor.
    They occupied the seats of honour in the company of the assembled disciples of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. To them he addressed his discourse, and towards them he showed
    marked consideration and courtesy. And yet he often, in covert and subtle phrases, I alluded to their blindness, their vainglory and utter inaptitude for
    the apprehension of the mysteries of Divine utterance. Among his allusions were the following: “None can comprehend my language except him who is begotten
    of me.” Oftentimes he quoted this saying: “I am spellbound by the vision. I am mute with wonder, and behold the world bereft of the power of hearing. I am
    powerless to divulge the mystery, and find the people incapable of bearing its weight.” On another occasion he remarked: “Many are those who claim to have
    attained union with the Beloved, and yet that Beloved refuses to acknowledge their claim. By the tears which he sheds for his loved One can the true lover
    be distinguished from the false.” Many a time he observed: “He who is destined to be made manifest after me is of pure lineage, of illustrious descent, of
the seed of <mark class="term misspelled">Fátimih</mark><mark class="term correction">Fáṭimih</mark>. He is of medium height, and is free from bodily deficiency.”<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title="">[††††††††††††††]</a><a name="Page_39"></a>I have heard <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark><a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> recount the following: “I, together with a
    number of the disciples of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, regarded the allusions to these deficiencies, from which the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> declared the promised One to be free, as
    specifically directed toward three individuals amongst our <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>. We even designated them by such appellations as indicated their bodily
    defects. One of them was <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Karím</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>,<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> son of <mark class="term correct">Ibráhím</mark><u>Kh</u><mark class="term unknown">án-i-Qájár-i-Kirmání</mark>, who was both <mark class="term unknown">one-eyed</mark> and sparsely bearded. Another was <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Gawhar</mark>, an exceptionally corpulent man. The third was <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muhit-i-<u>Sh</u>a’ir-i-Kirmání</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥíṭ-i-<u>Sh</u>á‘ir-i-Kirmání</mark>, who was extraordinarily lean and tall. We felt convinced that these were none other than those to whom the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>
    constantly alluded as those vain and faithless people who would eventually reveal their real selves, and betray their ingratitude and folly. As to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Karím</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who for years sat at the feet of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> and acquired from him all his <mark class="term unknown">so-called</mark> learning, in the end he obtained leave from
    his master to settle in <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark>, and there engage in the promotion of the interests of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> and the dissemination of those traditions that clustered round
    the sacred memory of the <mark class="term correct">Imáms</mark> of the Faith.
<p></p>“I was present in the library of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> when, one day, an attendant of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Karím</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> arrived, holding a book in his hand, which he
    presented to the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> on behalf of his master, requesting him to peruse it and to signify in his own handwriting his approval of its contents. The <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>
    read portions of that book, and returned it to the attendant with this message: <mark class="term unknown">‘Tell</mark> your master that he, better than anyone else, can estimate the value
    of his own book.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The attendant had retired when the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>, with sorrowful voice, remarked: <mark class="term unknown">‘Accursed</mark> be he! For years he has been associated with me, and
    now that he intends to depart, his one aim, after so many years of study and companionship, <a name="Page_40"></a>is to diffuse, through his book, such
    heretical and atheistic doctrines as he now wishes me to endorse. He has covenanted with a number of <mark class="term unknown">self-seeking</mark> hypocrites with the view of establishing
    himself in <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark>, and in order to assume, after my departure from this world, the reins of undisputed leadership. How grievously he erred in his judgment!
    For the breeze of divine Revelation, wafted from the <mark class="term unknown">Day-Spring</mark> of guidance, will assuredly quench his light and destroy his influence. The tree of his
    endeavour will eventually yield naught but the fruit of bitter disillusion and gnawing remorse. Verily I say, you shall behold this with your own eyes. My
    prayer for you is that you may be protected from the mischievous influence which he, the antichrist of the promised Revelation, will in future exercise.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
    He bade me conceal this prediction until the Day of Resurrection, the Day when the Hand of Omnipotence will have disclosed the secrets which are now hidden
    within the breasts of men. <mark class="term unknown">‘On</mark> that Day,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he exhorted me, <mark class="term unknown">‘arise</mark> with unswerving purpose and determination for the triumph of the Faith of God. Publish far
    and wide all that you have heard and witnessed.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” This same <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark>, who in the early days of the Dispensation proclaimed by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>
    thought it wiser and better not to identify himself with His Cause, cherished in his heart the fondest love for the revealed Manifestation, and in his
    faith remained firm and immovable as the rock. Eventually that smouldering fire blazed forth in his soul and was responsible for such behaviour on his part
    as to cause him to suffer imprisonment in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, in the same dungeon within which <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was confined. He remained steadfast to the very end, and
    crowned a life of loving sacrifice with the glory of martyrdom.
<p></p>And as the days of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> drew to a close, he, whenever he met his disciples, whether in private converse or public discourse, exhorted them, saying:
    “O my beloved companions! Beware, beware, lest after me the world’s fleeting vanities beguile you. Beware lest you wax haughty and forgetful of God. It is
    incumbent upon you to renounce all comfort, all earthly possessions and kindred, in your quest of Him who is the Desire of your hearts and of mine. Scatter
    far and wide, detach yourselves from all earthly things, and <a name="Page_41"></a>humbly and prayerfully beseech your Lord to sustain and guide you. Never
    relax in your determination to seek and find Him who is concealed behind the veils of glory. Persevere till the time when He, who is your true Guide and
    Master, will graciously aid you and enable you to recognise Him. Be firm till the day when He will choose you as the companions and the heroic supporters
    of the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>. Well is it with every one of you who will quaff the cup of martyrdom in His path. Those of you whom God, in His wisdom, will
    preserve and keep to witness the setting of the Star of Divine guidance, that Harbinger of the Sun of Divine Revelation, must needs be patient, must remain
    assured and steadfast. Such ones amongst you must neither falter nor feel dismayed. For soon after the first <mark class="term unknown">trumpet-blast</mark> which is to smite the earth with
    extermination and death, there shall be sounded again yet another call, at which all things will be quickened and revived. Then will the meaning of these
    sacred verses be revealed: <mark class="term unknown">‘And</mark> there was a blast on the trumpet, and all who are in the heavens and all who are in the earth expired, save those whom God
    permitted to live. Then was there sounded another blast, and, lo! arising, they gazed around them. And the earth shone with the light of her Lord, and the
Book was set, and the Prophets were brought up, and the witnesses; and judgment was given between them with equity; and none was wronged.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title="">[***************]</a> Verily I say, after the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> the <mark class="term correct">Qayyúm</mark><a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title="">[†††††††††††††††]</a> will be made manifest. For <a name="Page_42"></a>when the star of the Former has set, the
sun of the beauty of <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> will rise and illuminate the whole world. Then will be unfolded in all its glory the ‘mystery’ and the ‘secret’ spoken of by    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, who has said: <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> mystery of this Cause must needs be made manifest, and the secret of this Message must needs be divulged.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
    To have attained unto that Day of days is to have attained unto the crowning glory of past generations, and one goodly deed performed in that age is equal
    to the pious worship of countless centuries. How often has that venerable soul, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, recited those verses of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> already
    referred to! What stress he laid upon their significance as foreshadowing the advent of those twin Revelations which are to follow each other in rapid
    succession, and each of which is destined to suffuse the world with all its glory! How many times did he exclaim: <mark class="term unknown">‘Well</mark> is it with him who will recognise
    their significance and behold their splendour!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> How often, addressing me, did he remark: <mark class="term unknown">‘Neither</mark> of us shall live to gaze upon their effulgent glory. But
    many of the faithful among your disciples shall witness the Day which we, alas, can never hope to behold!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> O my beloved companions! How great, how very
    great, is the Cause! How exalted the station to which I summon you! How great the mission for which I have trained and prepared you! Gird up the loins of
    endeavour, and fix your gaze upon His promise. I pray to God graciously to assist you to weather the storms of tests and trials which must needs beset you,
    to enable you to emerge, unscathed and triumphant, from their midst, and to lead you to your high destiny.”
<p></p><p>Every year, in the month of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Dh</u>i’l-Qádih</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Dh</u>i’l-Qa‘dih</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> would proceed from <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> to <mark class="term misspelled">Kazímayn</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓimayn</mark>    <a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> in order to visit the shrines of the <mark class="term correct">imáms</mark>. He would return to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> in time to visit,
    on the day of <mark class="term misspelled">Árafih</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Arafih</mark>, the shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. In that year, the last year of his life, he, faithful to his custom, departed from <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> in the
    first days of the month of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Dh</u>i’l-Qádih</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Dh</u>i’l-Qa‘dih</mark>, in the year 1259 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> accompanied by a
    number of his companions and friends. On the fourth day of that month he arrived at the <mark class="term misspelled">Masjid-i-Bara<u>th</u>a</mark> <mark class="term correction">Masjid-i-Bará<u>th</u>á</mark>, situated <a name="Page_43"></a>on the
    highway between <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled">Kazímayn</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓimayn</mark>, in time to offer up his noonday prayer. He bade the <mark class="term misspelled">Mua<u>dhdh</u>in</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu’a<u>dh</u><u>dh</u>in</mark> summon the faithful to gather and pray.
    Standing beneath the shade of a palm which faced the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>, he joined the congregation, and had just concluded his devotions when an Arab suddenly
    appeared, approached the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>, and embraced him. “Three days ago,” he said, “I was shepherding my flock in this adjoining pasture, when sleep suddenly
    fell upon me. In my dream I saw <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, the Apostle of God, who addressed me in these words: <mark class="term unknown">‘Give</mark> ear, O shepherd, to My words, and treasure them within
    your heart. For these words of Mine are the trust of God which I commit to your keeping. If you be faithful to them, great will be your reward. If you
neglect them, grievous retribution will befall you. Hear Me; this is the trust with which I charge you: Stay within the precincts of the <mark class="term misspelled">Masjid-i-Bara<u>th</u>a</mark> <mark class="term correction">Masjid-i-Bará<u>th</u>á</mark>. On the third day after this dream, a scion of My house, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> by name, will, accompanied by his friends and companions,    <a name="Page_44"></a>alight, at the hour of noon, beneath the shadow of the palm in the vicinity of the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>. There he will offer his prayer. As soon as
    your eyes fall upon him, seek his presence and convey to him My loving greetings. Tell him, from Me: “Rejoice, for the hour of your departure is at hand.
When you shall have performed your visits in <mark class="term misspelled">Kazímayn</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓimayn</mark> and shall have returned to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, there, three days after your return, on the day of <mark class="term misspelled">Árafih</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Arafih</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title="">[****************]</a> you will wing your flight to Me. Soon after shall He who is the Truth be made manifest.
    Then <a name="Page_45"></a>shall the world be illuminated by the light of His face.”<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” A smile wreathed the countenance of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> upon the completion
    of the description of the dream related by that shepherd. He said: “Of the truth of the dream which you have dreamt there is no doubt.” His companions were
    sorely grieved. Turning to them, he said: “Is not your love for me for the sake of that true One whose advent we all await? Would you not wish me to die,
    that the promised One may be revealed?” This episode, in its entirety, has been related to me by no less than ten persons, all of whom were present on that
    occasion, and who testified to its accuracy. And yet many of those who witnessed with their own eyes such marvellous signs have rejected the Truth and
    repudiated His Message!
</p>This strange event was noised abroad. It brought sadness to the heart of the true lovers of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. To these he, with infinite tenderness and joy,
    addressed words of cheer and comfort. He calmed their troubled hearts, fortified their faith, and inflamed their zeal. With dignity and calm he completed
    his pilgrimage and returned to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. The very day of his arrival he fell ill, and was confined to bed. His enemies spread the rumour that he had been
    poisoned by the Governor of <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>. This was sheer calumny and downright falsehood, inasmuch as the Governor himself had placed his unqualified
confidence in <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, and had always regarded him as a highly talented leader endowed with keen perception and possessed of irreproachable character.    <a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title="">[††††††††††††††††]</a> On the day of <mark class="term misspelled">Árafih</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Arafih</mark>, in the year 1259 A.H., at the ripe age of sixty, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, in
    accordance with the vision of that lowly shepherd, bade farewell to this world, leaving behind him a band of earnest and devoted disciples who, purged of
all worldly desire, set out in quest of their promised Beloved. His sacred remains were interred within the precincts of the shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> His passing raised <a name="Page_46"></a>a tumult in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> similar to the agitation
    that seized its people the preceding year,<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> on the eve of the day of <mark class="term misspelled">Árafih</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Arafih</mark>, when the
    victorious enemy forced the gates of the citadel and massacred a considerable number of its besieged inhabitants. A year before, on that day, his house had
    been the one haven of peace and security for the bereaved and homeless, whereas now it had become a house of sorrow where those whom he had befriended and
    succoured bewailed his passing and mourned his loss.<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title="">[*****************]</a><a name="Page_47"></a>CHAPTER III: THE DECLARATION OF THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>’S MISSIONTHE death of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> was the signal for renewed activity on the part of his enemies. Athirst for leadership, and emboldened by his removal and the
    consequent dismay of his followers, they reasserted their claims and prepared to realise their ambitions. For a time, fear and anxiety filled the hearts of
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>’s faithful disciples, but with the return of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Bu<u>sh</u>rú’í</mark> from the highly successful mission with which he had been
    entrusted by his teacher, their gloom was dispelled.<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title="">[†††††††††††††††††]</a><p></p>It was on the first day of <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark>, in the year 1260 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> that <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> came back
    to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. He cheered and strengthened the disconsolate disciples of his beloved chief, reminded them of his unfailing promise, and pleaded for unrelaxing
    vigilance and unremitting effort in their search for the concealed Beloved. Living in the close neighbourhood of the house the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> had occupied, he, for
    three days, was engaged continually in receiving visits from a considerable number of mourners who hastened to convey to him, as the leading representative
    of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>’s disciples, the expression of their distress and sorrow. He afterwards summoned a group of his most distinguished and trusted
    <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> and enquired about the expressed wishes and the last exhortations of their departed leader. They told him that, repeatedly and
    emphatically, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> had bidden them quit their homes, scatter far and wide, purge their hearts from every idle desire, and dedicate themselves to
    the quest of Him to whose advent he had so often alluded. “He told us,” they said, “that the Object of our quest was now <a name="Page_48"></a>revealed.
    The veils that intervened between you and Him are such as only you can remove by your devoted search. Nothing short of prayerful endeavour, of purity of
    motive, of singleness of mind, will enable you to tear them asunder. Has not God revealed in His Book: <mark class="term unknown">‘Whoso</mark> maketh efforts for Us, in Our ways will We
    guide <mark class="term unknown">them’</mark>?”<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> “Why, then,” <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> observed, “have you chosen to tarry in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>?
    Why is it that you have not dispersed, and arisen to carry out his earnest plea?” “We acknowledge our failure,” was their reply; “to your greatness we all
    bear witness. Such is our confidence in you, that if you claim to be the promised One, we shall all readily and unquestionably submit. We herein pledge our
    loyalty and obedience to whatever you bid us perform.” “God forbid!” exclaimed <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. “Far be it from His glory that I, who am but dust, should be
    compared to Him who is the Lord of Lords! Had you been conversant with the tone and language of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, you never would have uttered such words. Your
    first obligation, as well as mine, is to arise and carry out, both in the spirit and in the letter, the dying message of our beloved chief.” He arose
    instantly from his seat, and went directly to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Gawhar</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muhit</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥíṭ</mark>, and other <mark class="term unknown">well-known</mark> figures among the disciples of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. To each
    and all he fearlessly delivered the parting message of his chief, emphasised the pressing character of their duty, and urged them to arise and fulfil it.
    To his plea they returned evasive and unworthy answers. “Our enemies,” one of them remarked, “are many and powerful. We must remain in this city and guard
    the vacant seat of our departed chief.” Another observed: “It is incumbent upon me to stay and care for the children whom the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> has left behind.”
    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> immediately recognised the futility of his efforts. Realising the degree of their folly, their blindness and ingratitude, he spoke to them no
    more. He retired, leaving them to their idle pursuits.
<p></p>As the year sixty, the year that witnessed the birth of the promised Revelation, had just dawned upon the world, it would not seem inappropriate, at this
    juncture, to digress from our theme, and to mention certain traditions of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><a name="Page_49"></a>and of the <mark class="term correct">imáms</mark> of the Faith which bear specific
    reference to that year. <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far</mark><mark class="term correction">Ja‘far</mark>, son of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, when questioned concerning the year in which the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> was to be made manifest, replied as follows:
    “Verily, in the year sixty His Cause shall be revealed, and His name shall be noised abroad.” In the works of the learned and <mark class="term unknown">far-famed</mark><mark class="term unknown">Muhyi’d-Dín-i-‘Arabí</mark>, many references are to be found regarding both the year of the advent and the name of the promised Manifestation. Among them are the
    following: “The ministers and upholders of His Faith shall be of the people of Persia.” “In His name, the name of the Guardian [<mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>] precedeth that of the
    Prophet [<mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>].” “The year of His Revelation is identical with half of that number which is divisible by nine [2520].” <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-i-A<u>kh</u>barí</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-i-A<u>kh</u>bárí</mark>,
    in his poems relating to the year of the Manifestation, <a name="Page_50"></a>makes the following prediction: “In the year <u>Gh</u>ars [the numerical
    value of the letters of which is 1260] the earth shall be illumined by His light, and in <mark class="term unknown"><u>Gh</u>arásih</mark> [1265] the world shall be suffused with its glory.
    If thou livest until the year <mark class="term unknown"><u>Gh</u>arasí</mark> [1270], thou shalt witness how the nations, the rulers, the peoples, and the Faith of God shall all have been
    renewed.” In a tradition ascribed to the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, the Commander of the Faithful, it is likewise recorded: “In <u>Gh</u>ars the Tree of Divine guidance
    shall be planted.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, having acquitted himself of the obligation he felt to urge and awaken his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>, set out from <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> for <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark>. With him were
    <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥasan</mark>, his brother, and <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark>, his nephew, both of whom had accompanied him ever since his visit to his native town of <mark class="term correct">Bu<u>sh</u>rúyih</mark>,
    in the province of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. Arriving at the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-Kúfih</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> decided to spend forty days in that place, where he led a life of
    retirement and prayer. By his fasts and vigils he prepared himself for the holy adventure upon which he was soon to embark. In the exercise of these acts
    of worship, his brother alone was associated with him, while his nephew, who attended to their daily needs, observed the fasts, and in his hours of leisure
    joined them in their devotions.
</p>This cloistered calm with which they were surrounded was, after a few days, unexpectedly interrupted by the arrival of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">‘Alíy-i-Bastamí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Alíy-i-Basṭámí</mark>, one of the
    foremost disciples of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. He, together with twelve other companions, arrived at the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-Kúfih</mark>, where he found his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciple</mark><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> immersed in contemplation and prayer. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> was endowed with such vast learning, and was so deeply conversant with the teachings of <u>Sh</u>ay    <u>kh</u><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, that many regarded him as even superior to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. On several occasions he attempted to enquire from <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> as to his
    destination after the termination of the period of his retirement. Every time he approached him, he found him so wrapt in his devotions that he felt it
    impossible to venture a question. He soon decided to retire, like him, for forty days from the society of men. All his companions followed his example with
    the exception of three who acted as their personal attendants. <a name="Page_51"></a>Immediately after the completion of his forty <mark class="term unknown">days’</mark> retirement, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, together with his two companions, departed for <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark>. He left <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> by
    night, visited on his way the shrine of <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark>, and proceeded directly to <mark class="term correct">Bú<u>sh</u>ihr</mark>, on the Persian Gulf. There he started on his holy quest after the
    Beloved of his heart’s desire. There, for the first time, he inhaled the fragrance of Him who, for years, had led in that city the life of a merchant and
    humble citizen. <a name="Page_52"></a>There he perceived the sweet savours of holiness with which that Beloved’s countless invocations had so richly
    impregnated the atmosphere of that city.
<p></p>He could not, however, tarry longer in <mark class="term correct">Bú<u>sh</u>ihr</mark>. Drawn as if by a magnet which seemed to attract him irresistibly towards the north, he proceeded to    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. Arriving at the gate of that city, he instructed his brother and his nephew to proceed directly to the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-Íl<u>kh</u>ání</mark>, and there to
    remain until his arrival. He expressed the hope that, God willing, he would arrive in time to join them in their evening prayer.
<p></p>On that very day, a few hours before sunset, whilst walking outside the gate of the city, his eyes fell suddenly upon a Youth of radiant countenance, who
    wore a green turban and who, advancing towards him, greeted him with a smile of loving welcome. He embraced <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> with tender affection as though he
had been his intimate and lifelong friend. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> thought Him at first to be a disciple of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> who, on being informed of his approach to    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, had come out to welcome him.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad-i-Qazvíní</mark>, the martyr, who on several occasions had heard <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> recount to the early believers the story of his moving and historic
    interview with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, related to me the following: “I have heard <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> repeatedly and graphically describe the circumstances of that remarkable
    interview: <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> Youth who met me outside the gate of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> overwhelmed me with expressions of affection and <mark class="term unknown">loving-kindness</mark>. He extended to me a
warm invitation to visit His home, and there refresh myself after the fatigues of my journey. I prayed to be excused, pleading that my    <a name="Page_53"></a>two companions had already arranged for my stay in that city, and were now awaiting my return. “Commit them to the care of God,” was
    His reply; “He will surely protect and watch over them.” Having spoken these words, He bade me follow Him. I was profoundly impressed by the gentle yet
    compelling manner in which that strange Youth spoke to me. As I followed Him, His gait, the charm of His voice, the dignity of His bearing, served to
    enhance my first impressions of this unexpected meeting.
<p></p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘We</mark> soon found ourselves standing at the gate of a house of modest appearance. He knocked at the door, which was soon opened by an Ethiopian servant.
“Enter therein in peace, secure,”<a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title="">[******************]</a> were His words as He crossed the threshold    <a name="Page_54"></a>and motioned me to follow Him. His invitation, uttered with power and majesty, penetrated my soul. I thought it a good augury to be
    addressed in such words, standing as I did on the threshold of the first house I was entering in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, a city the very atmosphere of which had
    produced already an indescribable impression upon me. Might not my visit to this house, I thought to myself, enable me to draw nearer to the Object of my
    quest? Might it not hasten the termination of a period of intense longing, of strenuous search, of increasing anxiety, which such a quest involves? As I
    entered the house and followed my Host to His chamber, a feeling of unutterable joy invaded my being. Immediately <a name="Page_55"></a>we were seated, He
    ordered a ewer of water to be brought, and bade me wash away from my hands and feet the stains of travel. I pleaded permission to retire from His presence
    and perform my ablutions in an adjoining room. He refused to grant my request, and proceeded to pour the water over my hands. He then gave me to drink of a
    refreshing beverage, after which He asked for the samovar<a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title="">[††††††††††††††††††]</a> and Himself prepared the tea
    which He offered me.
<p></p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘Overwhelmed</mark> with His acts of extreme kindness, I arose to depart. “The time for evening prayer is approaching,” I ventured to observe. “I have promised
    my friends to join them at that hour in the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-Íl<u>kh</u>ání</mark>.” With extreme courtesy and calm He replied: “You must surely have made the hour of
    your return conditional upon the will and pleasure of God. It seems that His will has decreed otherwise. You need have no fear of having broken your
    pledge.” His dignity and <mark class="term unknown">self-assurance</mark> silenced me I renewed my ablutions and prepared for prayer. He, too, stood beside me and prayed. Whilst praying, I
    unburdened my soul, which <a name="Page_56"></a>was much oppressed, both by the mystery of this interview and the strain and stress of my search. I
    breathed this prayer: “I have striven with all my soul, O my God, and until now have failed to find Thy promised Messenger. I testify that Thy word faileth
    not, and that Thy promise is sure.”
<p></p><p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘That</mark> night, that memorable night, was the eve preceding the fifth day of <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádiyu’l-Avval</mark> <mark class="term correction">Jamádíyu’l-Avval</mark>, in the year 1260 A.H.    <a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> <a name="Page_57"></a>It was about an hour after sunset when my youthful Host began to
    converse with me. “Whom, after <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>,” He asked me, “do you regard as his successor and your leader?” “At the hour of his death,” I replied, “our
    departed teacher insistently exhorted us to forsake our homes, to scatter far and wide, in quest of the promised Beloved. I have, accordingly, journeyed to
    Persia, have arisen to accomplish his will, and am still engaged in my quest.” “Has your teacher,” He further enquired, “given you any detailed indications
    as to the distinguishing features of the promised One?” “Yes,” I replied, “He is of a pure lineage, is of illustrious descent, and of the seed of <mark class="term misspelled">Fátimih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Fáṭimih</mark>.
    As to His age, He is more than twenty and less than thirty. He is endowed with innate knowledge. He is of medium height, abstains from smoking, and is free
    from bodily deficiency.” He paused for a while and then with vibrant voice declared: “Behold, all these signs are manifest in Me!” He then considered each
    of the <mark class="term unknown">above-mentioned</mark> signs separately, and conclusively demonstrated that each and all were applicable to His person. I was greatly surprised, and
    politely observed: “He whose advent we await is a Man of unsurpassed holiness, and the Cause He is to reveal, a Cause of tremendous power. Many and diverse
    are the requirements which He who claims to be its visible embodiment must needs fulfil. How often has <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> referred to the vastness of the
    knowledge of the promised One! How often did he say: <mark class="term unknown">‘My</mark> own knowledge is but a drop compared with that with which He has been endowed. All my attainments
    are but a speck of dust in the face of the immensity of His knowledge. Nay, immeasurable is the difference!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” No sooner had those words dropped from my
    lips than I found myself seized with fear and remorse, such as I could neither conceal nor explain. I bitterly reproved myself, and resolved at that very
    moment to alter my attitude and to soften my tone. I vowed to God that should my Host again refer to the subject, I would, with the utmost humility, answer
    and say: “If you be willing to substantiate your claim, you will most assuredly deliver me from the anxiety and suspense which so heavily oppress my soul.
    I shall truly be indebted to you for such deliverance.” When I first started upon my quest, I determined to regard <a name="Page_58"></a>Illustrations: VIEWS OF THE UPPER ROOM OF THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>’S HOUSE IN <mark class="term unknown"><u>SH</u>ÍRÁZ</mark> WHERE HE DECLARED HIS MISSION.] <a name="Page_59"></a>the two following
    standards as those whereby I could ascertain the truth of whosoever might claim to be the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>. The first was a treatise which I had myself
    composed, bearing upon the abstruse and hidden teachings propounded by <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. Whoever seemed to me capable of
    unravelling the mysterious allusions made in that treatise, to him I would next submit my second request, and would ask him to reveal, without the least
    hesitation or reflection, a commentary on the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of Joseph, in a style and language entirely different from the prevailing standards of the time. I had
    previously requested <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, in private, to write a commentary on that same <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark>, which he refused, saying: “This is, verily, beyond me. He, that
    great One, who comes after me will, unasked, reveal it for you. That commentary will constitute one of the weightiest testimonies of His truth, and one of
    the clearest evidences of the loftiness of His position.”<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a>
</p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> was revolving these things in my mind, when my distinguished Host again remarked: “Observe attentively. Might not the Person intended by <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>
    be none other than I?” I thereupon felt impelled to present to Him a copy of the treatise which I had with me. “Will you,” I asked Him, “read this book of
    mine and look at its pages with indulgent eyes? I pray you to overlook my weaknesses and failings.” He graciously complied with my wish. He opened the
    book, glanced at certain passages, closed it, and began to address me. Within a few minutes He had, with characteristic vigour and charm, unravelled all
    its mysteries and resolved all its problems. Having to my entire satisfaction accomplished, within so short a time, the task I had expected Him to perform,
He further expounded to me certain truths which could be found neither in the reported sayings of the <mark class="term correct">imáms</mark> of the Faith nor in the writings of <u>Sh</u>ay    <u>kh</u><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. These truths, which I had never heard before, seemed to be endowed with refreshing vividness and power. “Had you not been
    My guest,” He afterwards <a name="Page_60"></a>Illustrations: HIS BEDCHAMBER. HIS MOTHER’S ROOM. HIS SITTING ROOM. VIEWS OF THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>’S HOUSE IN <mark class="term unknown"><u>SH</u>ÍRÁZ</mark>.] <a name="Page_61"></a>observed, “your
    position would indeed have been a grievous one. The <mark class="term unknown">all-encompassing</mark> grace of God has saved you. It is for God to test His servants, and not for His
    servants to judge Him in accordance with their deficient standards. Were I to fail to resolve your perplexities, could the Reality that shines within Me be
    regarded as powerless, or My knowledge be accused as faulty? Nay, by the righteousness of God! it behoves, in this day, the peoples and nations of both the
    East and the West to hasten to this threshold, and here seek to obtain the reviving grace of the Merciful. Whoso hesitates will indeed be in grievous loss.
    Do not the peoples of the earth testify that the fundamental purpose of their creation is the knowledge and adoration of God? It behoves them to arise, as
    earnestly and spontaneously as you have arisen, and to seek with determination and constancy their promised Beloved.” He then proceeded to say: “Now is the
    time to reveal the commentary on the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of Joseph.” He took up His pen and with incredible rapidity revealed the entire <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of Mulk, the first chapter
    of His commentary on the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of Joseph. The overpowering effect of the manner in which He wrote was heightened by the gentle intonation of His voice
    which accompanied His writing. Not for one moment did He interrupt the flow of the verses which streamed from His pen. Not once did He pause till the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark>
    of Mulk was finished. I sat enraptured by the magic of His voice and the sweeping force of His revelation. At last I reluctantly arose from my seat and
    begged leave to depart. He smilingly bade me be seated, and said: “If you leave in such a state, whoever sees you will assuredly say: <mark class="term unknown">‘This</mark> poor youth has
lost his mind.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” At that moment the clock registered two hours and eleven minutes after sunset.    <a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title="">[*******************]</a> That night, the eve of the fifth day of <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádiyu’l-Avval</mark><mark class="term correction">Jamádíyu’l-Avval</mark>, in the year 1260 A.H.,
    corresponded with the eve preceding the <mark class="term unknown">sixty-fifth</mark> day after <mark class="term correct">Naw-rúz</mark>, which was also the eve of the sixth day of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urdád</mark>, of the year <mark class="term correct">Nahang</mark>. “This
night,” He declared, “this very hour will, in the days to come, be celebrated as one of the greatest and most significant of all festivals. Render thanks    <a name="Page_62"></a>to God for having graciously assisted you to attain your heart’s desire, and for having quaffed from the sealed wine of His
    utterance. <mark class="term unknown">‘Well</mark> is it with them that attain thereunto.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††]</a><p></p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘At</mark> the third hour after sunset, my Host ordered the dinner to be served. That same Ethiopian servant appeared again and spread before us the choicest
    food. That holy repast refreshed alike my body and soul. In the presence of my Host, at that hour, I felt as though I were feeding upon the fruits of
    Paradise. I could not but marvel at the manners and the devoted attentions of that Ethiopian servant whose very life seemed to have been transformed by the
    regenerating influence of his Master. I then, for the first time, recognised the significance of this <mark class="term unknown">well-known</mark> traditional utterance ascribed to
    <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>: “I have prepared for the godly and righteous among My servants what eye hath seen not, ear heard not, nor human heart conceived.” Had my youthful
    Host no other claim to greatness, this were sufficient—that He received me with that quality of hospitality and <mark class="term unknown">loving-kindness</mark> which I was convinced no
    other human being could possibly reveal.
<p></p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> sat spellbound by His utterance, oblivious of time and of those who awaited me. Suddenly the call of the <mark class="term misspelled">mua<u>dhdh</u>ín</mark><mark class="term correction">mua<u>dh</u><u>dh</u>in</mark>, summoning the faithful to
    their morning prayer, awakened me from the state of ecstasy into which I seemed to have fallen. All the delights, all the ineffable glories, which the
    Almighty has recounted in His Book as the priceless possessions of the people of Paradise—these I seemed to be experiencing that night. Methinks I was in a
    place of which it could be truly said: “Therein no toil shall reach us, and therein no weariness shall touch us”; “No vain discourse shall they hear
    therein, nor any falsehood, but only the cry, <mark class="term unknown">‘Peace</mark>! Peace!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”; “Their cry therein shall be, <mark class="term unknown">‘Glory</mark> be to Thee, O God!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> and their salutation therein,
    <mark class="term unknown">‘Peace</mark>!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> And the close of their cry, <mark class="term unknown">‘Praise</mark> be to God, Lord of all creatures!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><p></p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘Sleep</mark> had departed from me that night. I was enthralled by the music of that voice which rose and fell as He <a name="Page_63"></a>chanted; now swelling
    forth as He revealed verses of the <mark class="term misspelled">Qayyúmu’l-Asmá</mark><mark class="term correction">Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’</mark>,<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> again acquiring ethereal, subtle
    harmonies as He uttered the prayers He was revealing.<a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77" title="">[********************]</a> At the end of each invocation,
    He would repeat this verse: “Far from the glory of thy Lord, the <mark class="term unknown">All-Glorious</mark>, be that which His creatures affirm of Him! And peace be upon His Messengers!
    And praise be to God, the Lord of all beings!”<a href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††]</a><p></p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘He</mark> then addressed me in these words: “O thou who art the first to believe in Me! Verily I say, I am the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, the Gate of God, and thou art the
    <mark class="term correct">Bábu’l-Báb</mark>, the gate of that Gate. Eighteen souls must, in the beginning, spontaneously and of their own accord, accept Me and recognise the truth of My
    Revelation. Unwarned and uninvited, each of these must seek independently to find Me. And when their number is complete, one of them must needs be chosen
    to accompany Me on My pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. There I shall deliver the Message of God to the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>aríf</mark><mark class="term correction">Sharíf</mark> of Mecca. I then shall return to <mark class="term correct">Kúfih</mark>,
    where again, in the Masjid of that holy city, I shall manifest His Cause. It is incumbent upon you not to divulge, either to your companions or to any
    other soul, that which you have seen and heard. Be engaged in the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-Íl<u>kh</u>ání</mark> in prayer and in teaching. I, too, will there join you in
    congregational prayer. Beware lest your attitude towards Me betray the secret of your faith. You should continue in this occupation and maintain this
    attitude until our departure for <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark>. Ere we depart, we shall appoint unto each of the eighteen souls his special mission, and shall send them forth to
    accomplish their task. We shall instruct them to teach the Word of God and to quicken the souls of men.” Having spoken these words to me, He dismissed me
    from His presence. Accompanying <a name="Page_64"></a>Illustrations: ORIGINAL WINDOW SASH AND DOOR. STEPS LEADING TO THE DECLARATION CHAMBER. ENTRANCE. VIEWS OF THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>’S HOUSE IN <mark class="term unknown"><u>SH</u>ÍRÁZ</mark> WHERE HE
    DECLARED HIS MISSION.] <a name="Page_65"></a>me to the door of the house, He committed me to the care of God.
<p></p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘This</mark> Revelation, so suddenly and impetuously thrust upon me, came as a thunderbolt which, for a time, seemed to have benumbed my faculties.    <a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> I was blinded by its dazzling splendour and overwhelmed by its crushing force.
    Excitement, joy, awe, and wonder stirred the depths of my soul. Predominant among these emotions was a sense of gladness and strength which seemed to have
    transfigured me. How feeble and impotent, how dejected and timid, I had felt previously! Then I could neither write nor walk, so tremulous were my hands
    and feet. Now, however, the knowledge of His Revelation had galvanised my being. I felt possessed of such courage and power that were the world, all its
    peoples and its potentates, to rise against me, I would, alone and undaunted, withstand their onslaught. The universe seemed but a handful of dust in my
    grasp. I seemed to be the Voice of Gabriel personified, calling unto all mankind: “Awake, for lo! the morning Light has broken. Arise, for His Cause is
    made manifest. The portal of His grace is open wide; enter therein, O peoples of the world! For He who is your promised One is come!”
<p></p><p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘In</mark> such a state I left His house and joined my brother and nephew. A large number of the followers of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, who had heard of my
    arrival, had gathered in the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-Íl<u>kh</u>ání</mark> to meet me. Faithful to the directions of my newly found Beloved, I immediately set myself to carry
    out His wishes. As I began to organise my classes and perform my devotions, a vast concourse of people gathered gradually about me. Ecclesiastical
dignitaries and officials of the city also came to visit me. They marvelled at the spirit which my lectures revealed, unaware that the Source    <a name="Page_66"></a>whence my knowledge flowed was none other than He whose advent they, for the most part, were eagerly awaiting.
</p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘During</mark> those days I was, on several occasions, summoned by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to visit Him. He would send at <mark class="term unknown">night-time</mark> that same Ethiopian servant to the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>,
    bearing to me His most loving message of welcome. Every time I visited Him, I spent the entire night in His presence. Wakeful until the dawn, I sat at His
    feet fascinated by the charm of His utterance and oblivious of the world and its cares and pursuits. How rapidly those precious hours flew by! At daybreak
    I reluctantly withdrew from His presence. How eagerly in those days I looked forward to the approach of the evening hour! With what feelings of sadness and
    regret I beheld the dawning of day! In the course of one of these nightly visits, my Host addressed me in these words: “<mark class="term unknown">To-morrow</mark> thirteen of your
    companions will arrive. To each of them extend the utmost <mark class="term unknown">loving-kindness</mark>. Leave them not to themselves, for they have dedicated their lives to the quest
    of their Beloved. Pray to God that He may graciously enable them to walk securely in that path which is finer than a hair and keener than a sword. Certain
    ones among them will be accounted, in the sight of God, as His chosen and favoured disciples. As to others, they will tread the middle way. The fate of the
rest will remain undeclared until the hour when all that is hidden shall be made manifest.”    <a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><p></p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘That</mark> same morning, at sunrise, soon after my return from the home of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">‘Alíy-i-Bastamí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Alíy-i-Basṭámí</mark>, accompanied by the same number of companions as
    indicated to me, arrived at the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-Íl<u>kh</u>ání</mark>. I immediately set about to provide the means for their comfort. One night, a few days after their
    arrival, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, as the spokesman of his companions, gave vent to feelings which he could no longer repress. “You know well,” he said, “how great is
    our confidence in you. We bear you such loyalty that if you should claim to be the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> we would all unhesitatingly submit. Obedient to your
    summons, we have forsaken our <a name="Page_67"></a>homes and have gone forth in search of our promised Beloved. You were the first to set us all this
    noble example. We have followed in your footsteps. We have determined not to relax in our efforts until we find the Object of our quest. We have followed
    you to this place, ready to acknowledge whomsoever you accept, in the hope of seeking the shelter of His protection and of passing successfully through the
    tumult and agitation that must needs signalise the last Hour. How is it that we now see you teaching the people and conducting their prayers and devotions
    with the utmost tranquillity? Those evidences of agitation and expectancy seem to have vanished from your countenance. Tell us, we beseech you, the reason,
    that we too may be delivered from our present state of suspense and doubt.” “Your companions,” I gently observed, “may naturally attribute my peace and
    composure to the ascendancy which I seem to have acquired in this city. The truth is far from that. The world, I assure you, with all its pomp and
    seductions, can never lure away this <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Bu<u>sh</u>rúyih</mark> from his Beloved. Ever since the beginning of this holy enterprise upon which I have
    embarked, I have vowed to seal, with my <mark class="term unknown">life-blood</mark>, my own destiny. For His sake I have welcomed immersion in an ocean of tribulation. I yearn not for the
    things of this world. I crave only the good pleasure of my Beloved. Not until I shed my blood for His name will the fire that glows within me be quenched.
    Please God you may live to witness that day. Might not your companions have thought that, because of the intensity of his longing and the constancy of his
    endeavours, God has, in His infinite mercy, graciously deigned to unlock before the face of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> the Gate of His grace, and, wishing, according to
    His inscrutable wisdom, to conceal this fact, has bidden him engage in such pursuits?” These words stirred the soul of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>. He at once perceived
    their meaning. With tearful eyes he entreated me to disclose the identity of Him who had turned my agitation into peace and converted my anxiety into
    certitude. “I adjure you,” he pleaded, “to bestow upon me a portion of that holy draught which the Hand of mercy has given you to drink, for it will
    assuredly allay my thirst, and ease the pain of longing in my heart.” “Beseech me not,” <a name="Page_68"></a>I replied, “to grant you this favour. Let
    your trust be in Him, for He will surely guide your steps, and appease the tumult of your heart.”<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> hastened to his companions and acquainted them with the nature of his conversation with <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. Ablaze with the fire which the account of
    that conversation had kindled in their hearts, they immediately dispersed, and, seeking the seclusion of their cells, besought, through fasting and prayer,
    the early removal of the veil that intervened between them and the recognition of their Beloved. They prayed while keeping their vigils: “O God, our God!
    Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help. Guide us, we beseech Thee, on the straight Path, O Lord our God! Fulfil what Thou hast promised
    unto us by Thine Apostles, and put us not to shame on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, Thou wilt not break Thy promise.”
</p><p>On the third night of his retirement, whilst wrapt in prayer, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">‘Alíy-i-Bastamí</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Alíy-i-Basṭámí</mark> had a vision. There appeared before his eyes a light, and, lo! that
    light moved off before him. Allured by its splendour, he followed it, till at last it led him to his promised Beloved. At that very hour, in the
    <mark class="term unknown">mid-watches</mark> of the night, he arose and, exultant with joy and radiant with gladness, opened the door of his chamber and hastened to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. He threw
    himself into the arms of his revered companion. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> most lovingly embraced him and said: “Praise be to God who hath guided us hither! We had not
    been guided had not God guided us!”
</p><p>That very morning, at break of day, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, followed by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, hastened to the residence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. At the entrance of His house they met the
    faithful Ethiopian servant, who immediately recognised them and greeted them in these words: “Ere break of day, I was summoned to the presence of my
    Master, who instructed me to open the door of the house and to stand expectant at its threshold. <mark class="term unknown">‘Two</mark> guests,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He said, <mark class="term unknown">‘are</mark> to arrive early this morning.
    Extend to them in My name a warm welcome. Say to them from Me: “Enter therein in the name of God.”<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
</p><p>The first meeting of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, which was analogous to the meeting with <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, differed only in this respect, that whereas at the
    previous meeting the <a name="Page_69"></a>proofs and testimonies of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s mission had been critically scrutinised and expounded, at this one all
    argument had been set aside and nothing but the spirit of intense adoration and of close and ardent fellowship prevailed. The entire chamber seemed to have
    been vitalised by that celestial potency which emanated from His inspired utterance. Everything in that room seemed to be vibrating with this testimony:
    “Verily, verily, the dawn of a new Day has broken. The promised One is enthroned in the hearts of men. In His hand He holds the mystic cup, the chalice of
    immortality. Blessed are they who drink therefrom!”
</p><p>Each of the twelve companions of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, in his turn and by his own unaided efforts, sought and found his Beloved. Some in sleep, others in waking, a
    few whilst in prayer, and still others in their moments of contemplation, experienced the light of this Divine Revelation and were led to recognise the
    power of its glory. After the manner of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, these, and a few others, accompanied by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, attained the presence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and were
    declared “Letters of the Living.” Seventeen Letters were gradually enrolled in the preserved Tablet of God, and were appointed as the chosen Apostles of
    the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, the ministers of His Faith, and the diffusers of His light.
</p>One night, in the course of His conversation with <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>; the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> spoke these words: “Seventeen Letters have thus far enlisted under the standard of
    the Faith of God. There remains one more to complete the number. These Letters of the Living shall arise to proclaim My Cause and to establish My Faith.
    <mark class="term unknown">To-morrow</mark> night the remaining Letter will arrive and will complete the number of My chosen disciples.” The next day, in the evening hour, as the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>,
    followed by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, was returning to His home, there appeared a youth dishevelled and <mark class="term unknown">travel-stained</mark>. He approached <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, embraced him, and
    asked him whether he had attained his goal. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> tried at first to calm his agitation and advised him to rest for the moment, promising that he
    would subsequently enlighten him. That youth, however, refused to heed his advice. Fixing his gaze upon the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, he said to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>: “Why seek you to
    hide Him from me? I can recognise Him by His <a name="Page_70"></a>gait. I confidently testify that none besides Him, whether in the East or in the West,
    can claim to be the Truth. None other can manifest the power and majesty that radiate from His holy person.” <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> marvelled at his words. He
    pleaded to be excused, however, and induced him to restrain his feelings until such time as he would be able to acquaint him with the truth. Leaving him,
    he hastened to join the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and informed Him of his conversation with that youth. “Marvel not,” observed the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, “at his strange behaviour. We have in
    the world of the spirit been communing with that youth. We know him already. We indeed awaited his coming. Go to him and summon him forthwith to Our
    presence.” <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was instantly reminded by these words of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> of the following traditional utterance: “On the last Day, the Men of the Unseen
    shall, on the wings of the spirit, traverse the immensity of the earth, shall attain the presence of the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>, and shall seek from Him the secret
    that will resolve their problems and remove their perplexities.”
<p></p><p>Though distant in body, these heroic souls are engaged in daily communion with their Beloved, partake of the bounty of His utterance, and share the supreme
    privilege of His companionship. Otherwise how could <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> have known of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>? How could they have perceived the
    significance of the secret which lay hidden in Him? How could the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> Himself, how could <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, His beloved disciple, have written in such terms, had not
    the mystic bond of the spirit linked their souls together? Did not the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, in the earliest days of His Mission, allude, in the opening passages of the
    <mark class="term misspelled">Qayyúmu’l-Asmá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’</mark>, His commentary on the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of Joseph, to the glory and significance of the Revelation of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>? Was it not His purpose, by dwelling
    upon the ingratitude and malice which characterised the treatment of Joseph by his brethren, to predict what <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was destined to suffer at the
    hands of His brother and kindred? Was not <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, although besieged within the fort of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> by the battalions and fire of a
    relentless enemy, engaged, both in the daytime and in the <mark class="term unknown">night-season</mark>, in the completion of his eulogy of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>—that immortal commentary on the <mark class="term correct">Sád</mark>
    of <mark class="term misspelled">Samad</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣamad</mark> which <a name="Page_71"></a>had already assumed the dimensions of five hundred thousand verses? Every verse of the <mark class="term misspelled">Qayyúmu’l-Asmá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’</mark>, every word of
    the aforementioned commentary of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, will, if dispassionately examined, bear eloquent testimony to this truth.
</p>The acceptance by <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> of the truth of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s Revelation completed the assigned number of His chose disciples. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, whose name was <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>,
was, through his mother, a direct descendant of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, the grandson of the Prophet <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81" title="">[*********************]</a> He was born in <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>, in the province of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>. It has been
    reported by those who attended the lectures of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> that in the last years of the <mark class="term unknown">latter’</mark> life, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> enrolled himself <a name="Page_72"></a>as
    one of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>’s disciples. He was the last to arrive, and invariably occupied the lowliest seat in the assembly. He was the first to depart upon the
    conclusion of every meeting. The silence he observed and the modesty of his behaviour distinguished him from the rest of his companions. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> was
    often heard to remark that certain ones among his disciples, though they occupied the lowliest of seats, and observed the strictest silence, were none the
    less so exalted in the sight of God that he himself felt unworthy to rank among their servants. His disciples, although they observed the humility of
    <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and acknowledged the exemplary character of his behaviour, remained unaware of the purpose of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. When <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> arrived in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> and
    embraced the Faith declared by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, he was only <mark class="term unknown">twenty-two</mark> years of age. Though young in years, he showed that indomitable courage and faith which none
    among the disciples of his master could exceed. He exemplified by his life and glorious martyrdom the truth of this tradition: “Whoso seeketh Me, shall
    find Me. Whoso findeth Me, shall be drawn towards Me. Whoso draweth nigh unto Me, shall love Me. Whoso loveth Me, him shall I also love. He who is beloved
    of Me, him shall I slay. He who is slain by Me, I Myself shall be his ransom.”

    renowned for its nobility and which traced its origin to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Himself. The date of His birth confirmed the truth of the prophecy traditionally
    attributed to the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>: “I am two years younger than my Lord.” <mark class="term unknown">Twenty-five</mark> years, four months, and four days had elapsed since the day of His birth,
when he declared His Mission.

Faith, who placed Him, while still a child, under the care of a tutor named <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Abid</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Ábid</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" title="">[**********************]</a> The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, though not inclined to study, submitted to His uncle’s will and

    would in no wise attempt to pronounce them. I pretended not to know their meaning. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> know what these words signify,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> observed my pupil; <mark class="term unknown">‘by</mark> your leave, I
    will explain them.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He spoke with such knowledge and fluency that I was struck with amazement. He expounded the meaning of <mark class="term misspelled">‘Alláh</mark><mark class="term correction">Alláh</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">‘Rahmán</mark><mark class="term correction">Raḥmán</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> and
    <mark class="term misspelled">‘Raḥím</mark><mark class="term correction">Raḥím</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> in terms such as I had neither read nor heard. The sweetness of His utterance still lingers in my memory. I felt impelled to take Him back to His
    uncle and to deliver into his hands the Trust he had committed to my care. I determined to tell him how unworthy I felt to teach so remarkable a child. I
    found His uncle alone in his office. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> have brought Him back to you,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I said, <mark class="term unknown">‘and</mark> commit Him to your vigilant protection. He is not to be treated as a

It is incumbent upon you to surround Him with your most loving
    care. Keep Him in your house, for He, verily, stands in no need of teachers such as I.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> sternly rebuked the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. <mark class="term unknown">‘Have</mark> You forgotten

    His school. The soul of that child could not, however, be restrained by the stern admonitions of His uncle. No discipline could repress the flow of His
    intuitive knowledge. Day after day He continued to manifest such remarkable evidences of superhuman wisdom as I am powerless to recount.” At last His uncle
was induced to take Him away from the school of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abid</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Ábid</mark>, and to associate Him with himself in his own profession.    <a href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> There, too, He revealed signs of a power and greatness that few could approach and
    none could rival.
<p></p>Some years later<a href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89" title="">[***********************]</a> the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was united in wedlock with the sister of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark>.<a href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> The child which resulted from this union, He named

The Father did not
    lament his loss. He consecrated his death by words such as these: <a name="Page_77"></a>“O God, my God! Would that a thousand Ishmaels were given Me, this
    Abraham of Thine, that I might have offered them, each and all, as a loving sacrifice unto Thee. O my Beloved, my heart’s Desire! The sacrifice of this
    <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> whom Thy servant <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark> hath offered up on the altar of Thy love can never suffice to quench the flame of longing in His heart. Not until He
    immolates His own heart at Thy feet, not until His whole body falls a victim to the cruelest tyranny in Thy path, not until His breast is made a target for
    countless darts for Thy sake, will the tumult of His soul be stilled. O my God, my only Desire! Grant that the sacrifice of My son, My only son, may be
    acceptable unto Thee. Grant that it be a prelude to the sacrifice of My own, My entire self, in the path of Thy good pleasure. Endue with Thy grace My
    <mark class="term unknown">life-blood</mark> which I yearn to shed in Thy path. Cause it to water and nourish the seed of Thy Faith. Endow it with Thy celestial potency, that this infant
    seed of God may soon germinate in the hearts of men, that it may thrive and prosper, that it may grow to become a mighty tree, beneath the shadow of which
    all the peoples and kindreds of the earth may gather. Answer Thou My prayer, O God, and fulfil My most cherished desire. Thou art, verily, the Almighty,
    the <mark class="term unknown">All-Bountiful</mark>.”<a href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93" title="">[************************]</a>The days which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> devoted to commercial pursuits were mostly spent in <mark class="term correct">Bú<u>sh</u>ihr</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn94" name="_ftnref94" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> The oppressive heat of the summer did not deter Him from devoting, each Friday,
    several hours to continuous worship upon the roof of His house. Though exposed to the fierce rays of the noontide sun, He, turning His heart to His
    Beloved, continued to commune with Him, unmindful of the intensity of the heat <a name="Page_78"></a>and oblivious of the world around Him. From early dawn
    till sunrise, and from midday till late in the afternoon, He dedicated His time to meditation and pious worship. Turning His gaze towards the north, in the
    direction of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, He, at every break of day, greeted, with a heart overflowing with love and joy, the rising, sun, which to Him was a sign and symbol of
    that <mark class="term unknown">Day-Star</mark> of Truth that was soon to dawn upon the world. As a lover who beholds the face of his beloved, He gazed upon the rising orb with
    steadfastness and longing. He seemed to be addressing, in mystic language, that shining luminary, and to be entrusting it with His, message of yearning and
    love to His concealed Beloved. With such transports of delight He greeted its beaming rays, that the heedless and <a name="Page_79"></a>ignorant around Him
    thought Him to be enamoured with the sun itself.<a href="#_ftn95" name="_ftnref95" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><p></p>I have heard <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád-i-Karbilá’í</mark><a href="#_ftn96" name="_ftnref96" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> recount the following: “Whilst

As I was already acquainted with <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, I was enabled to meet the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> on several
    occasions. Every time I met Him, I found Him in such a state of humility and lowliness as words fail me to describe. His downcast eyes, His extreme
courtesy, and the serene expression of His face made an indelible impression upon my soul.    <a href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97" title="">[*************************]</a> I often heard those who were closely associated with Him testify to the purity
of His character, to the charm of His manners, to His <mark class="term unknown">self-effacement</mark>, to His high integrity, and to His extreme devotion to God.    <a href="#_ftn98" name="_ftnref98" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> A certain man confided to His care a trust, requesting Him to dispose of it at
    a fixed price. When the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> sent him the value of that article, the man found that the sum which he had been offered considerably exceeded the limit which
    he had fixed. He immediately wrote to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, requesting Him to explain the reason. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> replied: <mark class="term unknown">‘What</mark> I have sent you is entirely your due. There is
    not a single farthing in excess of <a name="Page_80"></a>what is your right. there was a time when the trust you had delivered to Me had attained this
    value. Failing to sell it at that price, I now feel it My duty to offer you the whole of that sum.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> However much the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s client entreated Him to receive
    back the sum in excess, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> persisted in refusing.

<p></p>These all, with the single exception of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>, attained the presence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and were personally invested by Him with the distinction of this rank.
    It was she who, having learned of the intended departure of her sister’s husband, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>, from <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, entrusted him with a sealed letter,

The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> forthwith declared her
one of the Letters of the Living. Her father, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣáliḥ-i-Qazvíní</mark>, and his brother, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, were both <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> of great renown,    <a href="#_ftn102" name="_ftnref102" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> were skilled in the traditions of Muslim law, and were universally respected
by the people of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, and other leading cities of Persia. She was married to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, son of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, her uncle, whom<a name="Page_83"></a>the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ahs</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ahs</mark> styled <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>ahíd-i-<u>Th</u>ali<u>th</u></mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>ahíd-i-<u>Th</u>áli<u>th</u></mark>.    <a href="#_ftn103" name="_ftnref103" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> Although her family belonged to the <mark class="term correct">Bálá-Sarí</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> alone showed, from
    the very beginning, a marked sympathy and devotion to <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. As an evidence of her personal admiration for him, she wrote an apology in defence and
    justification of the teachings of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and presented it to him. To this she soon received a reply, couched in the most affectionate
    terms, in the opening passages of which the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> thus addressed her: “O thou who art the solace of mine eyes (<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark><mark class="term correct">Qurrat-i-‘Ayní</mark>!), and the joy of my
    heart!” Ever since that time she has been known as <mark class="term correct">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark>. After the historic <a name="Page_84"></a>gathering of <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark>, a number of those
    who attended were so amazed at the fearlessness and outspoken language of that heroine, that they felt it their duty to acquaint the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> with the character
    of her startling and unprecedented behaviour. They strove to tarnish the purity of her name. To their accusations the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> replied: “What am I to say
    regarding her whom the Tongue of Power and Glory has named <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> [the Pure One]?” These words proved sufficient to silence those who had endeavoured to
undermine her position. From that time onwards she was designated by the believers as <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn104" name="_ftnref104" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><p></p>A word should now be said in explanation of the term <mark class="term correct">Bálá-Sarí</mark>. <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, as well as their followers, when visiting the
    shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, invariably occupied, as a mark of reverence, the lower end of the sepulchre. They never advanced beyond it, whereas
    other worshippers, the <mark class="term correct">Bálá-Sarí</mark>, recited their prayers in the upper section of that shrine. The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ís</mark>, believing, as they did, that
“every true believer lives both in this world and in the next,” felt it unseemly and improper to step beyond the limits of the lower sections of the shrine<a name="Page_85"></a>of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who in their eyes was the very incarnation of the most perfect believer.    <a href="#_ftn105" name="_ftnref105" title="">[***************************]</a><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who anticipated being the chosen companion of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> during His pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, was, as soon as the latter decided to depart
    from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, summoned to the presence of his Master, who gave him the following instructions: “The days of our companionship are approaching their
    end. My Covenant with you is now accomplished. Gird up the loins of endeavour, and arise to diffuse My Cause. Be not dismayed at the sight of the
    degeneracy and perversity of this generation, for the Lord of the Covenant shall assuredly assist you. Verily, He shall surround you with His loving
    protection, and shall lead you from victory to victory. Even as the cloud that rains its bounty upon the earth, traverse the land from end to end, and
    shower upon its people the blessings which the Almighty, in His mercy, has deigned to confer upon you. Forbear with the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark>, and resign yourself to the
    will of God. Raise the cry: <mark class="term unknown">‘Awake</mark>, awake, for, lo! the Gate of God is open, and the morning Light is shedding its radiance upon all mankind! The promised
    One is made manifest; prepare the way for Him, O people of the earth! Deprive not yourselves of its redeeming grace, nor close your eyes to its effulgent
    glory.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Those whom you find receptive to your call, share with them the epistles and tablets We have revealed for you, that, perchance, these wondrous
    words may cause them to turn away from the slough of heedlessness, and soar into the realm <a name="Page_86"></a>of the Divine presence. In this pilgrimage
    upon which We are soon to embark, We have chosen <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> as Our companion. We have left you behind to face the onslaught of a fierce and relentless enemy.
    Rest assured, however, that a bounty unspeakably glorious shall be conferred upon you. Follow the course of your journey towards the north, and visit on
    your way <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. Beseech almighty Providence that He may graciously enable you to attain, in that capital, the seat of
    true sovereignty, and to enter the mansion of the Beloved. A secret lies hidden in that city. When made manifest, it shall turn the earth into paradise. My
    hope is that you may partake of its grace and recognise its splendour. From <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> proceed to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, and there proclaim anew the Call. From
    thence return to <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, and there await the summons <a name="Page_87"></a>of your Lord. Be assured that the high mission for which you have
    been created will, in its entirety, be accomplished by you. Until you have consummated your work, if all the darts of an unbelieving world be directed
    against you, they will be powerless to hurt a single hair of your head. All things are imprisoned within His mighty grasp. He, verily, is the Almighty, the
    <mark class="term unknown">All-Subduing</mark>.”
<p></p><p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> then summoned to His presence <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">‘Alíy-i-Bastamí</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Alíy-i-Basṭámí</mark>, and addressed to him words of cheer and <mark class="term unknown">loving-kindness</mark>. He instructed him to proceed directly
    to <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, alluded to the severe trials and afflictions that would befall him, and enjoined him to be steadfast till the end. “Your faith,” He
    told him, “must be immovable as the rock, must weather every storm and survive every calamity. Suffer not the denunciations of the foolish and the
    calumnies of the clergy to afflict you, or to turn you from your purpose. For you are called to partake of the celestial banquet prepared for you in the
    immortal Realm. You are the first to leave the House of God, and to suffer for His sake. If you be slain in His path, remember that great will be your
    reward, and goodly the gift which will be bestowed upon you.”
</p><p>No sooner were these words uttered than <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> arose from his seat and set out to prosecute his mission. At about a <mark class="term correct">farsang</mark>’s distance from <u>Sh</u>
    <mark class="term unknown">íráz</mark> he was overtaken by a youth who, flushed with excitement, impatiently asked to speak to him. His name was <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>. “I beseech you,” he
    tearfully entreated <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, “to allow me to accompany you on your journey. Perplexities oppress my heart; I pray you to guide my steps in the way of
    Truth. Last night, in my dream, I heard the crier announce in the <mark class="term unknown">market-street</mark> of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> the appearance of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, the Commander of the
    Faithful. He called to the multitude: <mark class="term unknown">‘Arise</mark> and seek him. Behold, he plucks out of the burning fire charters of liberty and is distributing them to the
    people. Hasten to him, for whoever receives them from his hands will be secure from penal suffering, and whoever fails to obtain them from him, will be
    bereft of the blessings of Paradise.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Immediately I heard the voice of the crier, I arose and, abandoning my shop, ran across the <mark class="term unknown">market-street</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Vakíl</mark> to
    a place where my eyes beheld you standing and distributing <a name="Page_88"></a>those same charters to the people. To everyone who approached to receive
    them from your hands, you would whisper in his ear a few words which instantly caused him to flee in consternation and exclaim: <mark class="term unknown">‘Woe</mark> betide me, for I am
    deprived of the blessings of <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> and his kindred! Ah, miserable me, that I am accounted among the outcast and fallen !<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I awoke from my dream and,
    immersed in an ocean of thought, regained my shop. Suddenly I saw you pass, accompanied by a man who wore a turban, and who was conversing with you. I
    sprang from my seat and, impelled by a power which I could not repress, ran to overtake you. To my utter amazement, I found you standing upon the very site
    which I had witnessed in my dream, engaged in the recital of traditions and verses. Standing aside, at a distance, I kept watching you, wholly unobserved
    by you and your friend. I heard the man whom you were addressing, impetuously protest: <mark class="term unknown">‘Easier</mark> is it for me to be devoured by the flames of hell than to
    acknowledge the truth of your words, the weight of which mountains are unable to sustain!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> To his contemptuous rejection you returned this answer: <mark class="term unknown">‘Were</mark>
    all the universe to repudiate His truth, it could never tarnish the unsullied purity of His robe of grandeur.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Departing from him, you directed your steps
    towards the gate of <mark class="term misspelled">Kazirán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Kázirán</mark>. I continued to follow you until I reached this place.”
</p><p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> tried to appease his troubled heart and to persuade him to return to his shop and resume his daily work. “Your association with me,” he urged,
    “would involve me in difficulties. Return to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> and rest assured, for you are accounted of the people of salvation. Far be it from the justice
    of God to withhold from so ardent and devoted a seeker the cup of His grace, or to deprive a soul so athirst from the billowing ocean of His Revelation.”
    The words of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> proved of no avail. The more he insisted upon the return of <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>, the louder grew his lamentation and weeping. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>
    finally felt compelled to comply with his wish, resigning himself to the will of God. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Majíd</mark>, the father of <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>, has often been
    heard to recount, with eyes filled with tears, this story: “How deeply,” he said, “I regret the deed I committed. Pray that God may grant me the remission
    of my sin. I <a name="Page_89"></a>was one among the favoured in the court of the sons of the <mark class="term correct">Farmán-Farmá</mark>, the governor of the province of <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark>. Such was
    my position that none dared to oppose or harm me. No one questioned my authority or ventured to interfere with my freedom. Immediately I heard that my son
    <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark> had forsaken his shop and left the city, I ran out in the direction of the <mark class="term misspelled">Kazirán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Kázirán</mark> gate to overtake him. Armed with a club with which I
    intended to beat him, I enquired as to the road he had taken. I was told that a man wearing a turban had just crossed the street and that my son was seen
    following him. They seemed to have agreed to leave the city together. This excited my anger and indignation. How could I tolerate, I thought to myself,
    such unseemly behaviour on the part of my son, I, who already hold so privileged a position in the court of the sons of the <mark class="term correct">Farmán-Farmá</mark>? Nothing but the
    severest chastisement, I felt, could wipe away the effect of my son’s disgraceful conduct.
</p>“I continued my search until I reached them. Seized with a savage fury, I inflicted upon <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> unspeakable injuries. To the strokes that fell heavily
    upon him, he, with extraordinary serenity, returned this answer: <mark class="term unknown">‘Stay</mark> your hand, O <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Majíd</mark>, for the eye of God is observing you. I take Him as my
    witness, that I am in no wise responsible for the conduct of your son. I mind not the tortures you inflict upon me, for I stand prepared for the most
    grievous afflictions in the path I have chosen to follow. Your injuries, compared to what is destined to befall me in future, are as a drop compared to the
    ocean. Verily, I say, you shall survive me, and will come to recognise my innocence. Great will then be your remorse, and deep your sorrow.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Scorning his
    remarks, and heedless of his appeal, I continued to beat him until I was exhausted. Silently and heroically he endured this most undeserved chastisement at
    my hands. Finally, I ordered my son to follow me, and left <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> to himself. “On our way back to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, my son related to me the dream he had
    dreamt. A feeling of profound regret gradually seized me. The blamelessness of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> was vindicated in my eyes, and the memory of my cruelty to him
    continued long to oppress my soul. Its bitterness lingered in my heart until the time when I felt obliged to transfer my residence <a name="Page_90"></a>from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>. From <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark> I moved to <mark class="term misspelled">Kazímayn</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓimayn</mark>, where <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark> established his business. A strange mystery brooded
over his youthful face. He seemed to be concealing from me a secret which appeared to have transformed his life. And when, in the year 1267 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn106" name="_ftnref106" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> journeyed to <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark> and visited <mark class="term misspelled">Kazímayn</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓimayn</mark>, <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark> fell
    immediately under the spell of His charm and pledged his undying devotion to Him. A few years later, when my son had suffered martyrdom in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had been exiled to <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>, He, with infinite <mark class="term unknown">loving-kindness</mark> and mercy, awakened me from the sleep of heedlessness, and Himself taught
    me the message of the New Day, washing away with the waters of Divine forgiveness the stains of that cruel act.”
<p></p><p>This episode marks the first affliction which befell a disciple of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> after the declaration of His mission. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> realised from this experience
    how steep and thorny was the path leading to his eventual attainment of the promise given him by his Master. Wholly resigned to His will, and prepared to
    shed his <mark class="term unknown">life-blood</mark> for His Cause, he resumed his journey until he arrived at <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark>. In the presence of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥasan</mark>, one of the
    most celebrated ecclesiastics of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark> <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, and in the face of a distinguished company of his disciples, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> announced fearlessly the
    manifestation of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, the Gate whose advent they were eagerly awaiting. “His proof,” he declared, “is His Word; His testimony, none other than the
    testimony with which <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> seeks to vindicate its truth. From the pen of this unschooled <mark class="term correct">Há<u>sh</u>imite</mark> Youth of Persia there have streamed, within the
    space of <mark class="term unknown">forty-eight</mark> hours, as great a number of verses, of prayers, of homilies, and scientific treatises, as would equal in volume the whole of the
    <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, which it took <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, the Prophet of God, <mark class="term unknown">twenty-three</mark> years to reveal!” That proud and fanatic leader, instead of welcoming, in an age of
    darkness and prejudice, these <mark class="term unknown">life-giving</mark> evidences of a <mark class="term unknown">new-born</mark> Revelation, forthwith pronounced <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> a heretic and expelled him from the assembly.
    His disciples and followers, even the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ís</mark>, who already testified to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>’s piety, sincerity, and learning, endorsed,
    unhesitatingly, <a name="Page_91"></a>the judgment against him. The disciples of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥasan</mark>, joining hands with their adversaries,
    heaped upon him untold indignities. They eventually delivered him, his hands bound in chains, to an official of the Ottoman government, arraigning him as a
wrecker of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, a calumniator of the Prophet, an instigator of mischief, a disgrace to the Faith, and worthy of the penalty of death. He was taken to Ba    <mark class="term unknown"><u>gh</u>dád</mark> under the escort of government officials, and was cast into prison by the governor of that city.
</p><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Há<u>sh</u>im</mark>, surnamed <mark class="term misspelled">Attár</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aṭṭár</mark>, a prominent merchant, who was well versed in the Scriptures of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, recounted the following: “I was present at
    Government House on one occasion when <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> was summoned to the presence of the assembled notables and government officials of that city. He was
    publicly accused of being an infidel, an abrogator of the laws of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, and a repudiator of its rituals and accepted standards. When his alleged offences
    and misdeeds had been enumerated, the <mark class="term correct">Muftí</mark>, the chief exponent of the law of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> in that city, turned to him and said: <mark class="term unknown">‘O</mark> enemy of God!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> As I was
    occupying a seat beside the <mark class="term correct">Muftí</mark>, I whispered in his ear: <mark class="term unknown">‘You</mark> are as yet unacquainted with this unfortunate stranger. Why address him in such terms? Do
    you not realise that such words as you have addressed to him will excite the anger of the populace against him? It behoves you to disregard the unsupported
    charges these busybodies have brought against him, to question him yourself, and to judge him according to the accepted standards of justice inculcated by
    the Faith of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The <mark class="term correct">Muftí</mark> was sore displeased, arose from his seat, and left the gathering. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> was again thrown into prison. A few days later,
    I enquired about him, hoping to achieve his deliverance. I was informed that, on the night of that same day, he had been deported to Constantinople. I made
    further enquiries and endeavoured to find out what eventually befell him. I could not, however, ascertain the truth. A few believed that on his way to
Constantinople he had fallen ill and died. Others maintained that he had suffered martyrdom.”    <a href="#_ftn107" name="_ftnref107" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> Whatever <a name="Page_92"></a>his end, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> had by his life and
    death earned the immortal distinction of having been the first sufferer in the path of this new Faith of God, the first to have laid down his life as an
    offering on the Altar of Sacrifice.
<p></p>Having sent forth <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> on his mission, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> summoned to His presence the remaining Letters of the Living, and to each severally He gave a special
    command and appointed a special task. He addressed to them these parting words: “O My beloved friends! You are the bearers of the name of God in this Day.
    You have been chosen as the repositories of His mystery. It behoves each one of you to manifest the attributes of God, and to exemplify by your deeds and
    words the signs of His righteousness, His power and glory. The very members of your body must bear witness to the loftiness of your purpose, the integrity
of your life, the reality of your faith, and the exalted character of your devotion. For verily I say, this is the Day spoken of by God in His Book:    <a href="#_ftn108" name="_ftnref108" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><mark class="term unknown">‘On</mark> that day will We set a seal upon their mouths yet shall their hands
    speak unto Us, and their feet shall bear witness to that which they shall have done.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Ponder the words of Jesus addressed to His disciples, as He sent them
    forth to propagate the Cause of God. In words such as these, He bade them arise and fulfil their mission: <mark class="term unknown">‘Ye</mark> are even as the fire which in the darkness of
    the night has been kindled upon the <mark class="term unknown">mountain-top</mark>. Let your light shine before the eyes of men. Such must be the purity of your character and the degree of
    your renunciation, that the people of the earth may through you recognise and be drawn closer to the heavenly Father who is the Source of purity and grace.
    For none has seen the Father who is in heaven. You who are His spiritual children must by your deeds exemplify His virtues, and witness to His glory. You
    are the salt of the earth, but if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? Such must be the degree of your detachment, that into
    whatever city you enter to proclaim and teach the Cause of God, you should in no wise expect either meat or reward from its people. Nay, when you depart
    out of that city, you should shake the dust from off your feet. As you have entered it pure and <a name="Page_93"></a>undefiled, so must you depart from
    that city. For verily I say, the heavenly Father is ever with you and keeps watch over you. If you be faithful to Him, He will assuredly deliver into your
    hands all the treasures of the earth, and will exalt you above all the rulers and kings of the world.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> O My Letters! Verily I say, immensely exalted is
    this Day above the days of the Apostles of old. Nay, immeasurable is the difference! You are the witnesses of the Dawn of the promised Day of God. You are
the partakers of the mystic chalice of His Revelation. Gird up the loins of endeavour, and be mindful of the words of God as revealed in His Book:    <a href="#_ftn109" name="_ftnref109" title="">[****************************]</a><mark class="term unknown">‘Lo</mark>, the Lord thy God is come, and with Him is the company of His angels
    arrayed before Him!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Purge your hearts of worldly desires, and let angelic virtues be your adorning. Strive that by your deeds you may bear witness to the
    truth of these words of God, and beware lest, by <mark class="term unknown">‘turning</mark> back,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He may <mark class="term unknown">‘change</mark> you for another people,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> who <mark class="term unknown">‘shall</mark> not be your like,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> and who shall take
    from you the Kingdom of God. The days when idle worship was deemed sufficient are ended. The time is come when naught but the purest motive, supported by
    deeds of stainless purity, can ascend to the throne of the Most High and be acceptable unto Him. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> good word riseth up unto Him, and the righteous deed
will cause it to be exalted before Him.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> You are the lowly, of whom God has thus spoken in His Book:    <a href="#_ftn110" name="_ftnref110" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> “And We desire to show favour to those who were brought low in the land,
    and to make them spiritual leaders among men, and to make them Our heirs.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> You have been called to this station; you will attain to it, only if you arise
    to trample beneath your feet every earthly desire, and endeavour to become those <mark class="term unknown">‘honoured</mark> servants of His who speak not till He hath spoken, and who do
His bidding.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> You are the first Letters that have been generated from the Primal Point,    <a href="#_ftn111" name="_ftnref111" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> the first Springs that have welled out from the Source of this Revelation.
    Beseech the Lord your God to grant that no earthly entanglements, no worldly affections, no ephemeral pursuits, may tarnish the purity, or embitter the
    sweetness, of that grace which flows through you. I am preparing you for the advent of a mighty Day. Exert your utmost endeavour that, in the world to
    come, I, who am now instructing you, may, before the <mark class="term unknown">mercy-seat</mark> of <a name="Page_94"></a>God, rejoice in your deeds and glory in your achievements. The
    secret of the Day that is to come is now concealed. It can neither be divulged nor estimated. The newly born babe of that Day excels the wisest and most
    venerable men of this time, and the lowliest and most unlearned of that period shall surpass in understanding the most erudite and accomplished divines of
    this age. Scatter throughout the length and breadth of this land, and, with steadfast feet and sanctified hearts, prepare the way for His coming. Heed not
    your weaknesses and frailty; fix your gaze upon the invincible power of the Lord, your God, the Almighty. Has He not, in past days, caused Abraham, in
    spite of His seeming helplessness, to triumph over the forces of Nimrod? Has He not enabled Moses, whose staff was His only companion, to vanquish Pharaoh
    and his hosts? Has He not established the ascendancy of Jesus, poor and lowly as He was in the eyes of men, over the combined forces of the Jewish people?
    Has He not subjected the barbarous and militant tribes of Arabia to the holy and transforming discipline of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, His Prophet? Arise in His name, put
    your trust wholly in Him, and be assured of ultimate victory.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn112" name="_ftnref112" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><p></p>With such words the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> quickened the faith of His disciples and launched them upon their mission. To each He assigned his own native province as the field
of his labours. He directed them each and all to refrain from specific references to His own name and person.    <a href="#_ftn113" name="_ftnref113" title="">[*****************************]</a> He instructed them to raise the call that the Gate to the Promised One
    has been opened, that His proof is irrefutable, and that His testimony is complete. He bade them declare that whoever believes in Him has believed in all
    the prophets of God, and that whoever denies Him has denied all His saints and His chosen <a name="Page_95"></a>Illustration: THE MADRISH OF <mark class="term correct">NÍM-ÁVARD</mark>, <mark class="term correct">IṢFÁHÁN</mark>] <a name="Page_96"></a>ones. With these instructions He dismissed them from His presence and committed
    them to the care of God. Of these Letters of the Living, whom He thus addressed, there remained with Him in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, the first of these
    Letters, and <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, the last. The rest, fourteen in number, set out, at the hour of dawn, from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, each resolved to carry out, in its entirety,
    the task with which he had been entrusted.
<p></p>To <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, as the hour of his departure approached, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> addressed these words: “Grieve not that you have not been chosen to accompany Me on My
pilgrimage to <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark>. I shall, instead, direct your steps to that city which enshrines a Mystery of such transcendent holiness as neither <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark> nor    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> can hope to rival. My hope is that you may, by the aid of God, be enabled to remove the veils from the eyes of the wayward and to cleanse the
    minds of the malevolent. Visit, on your way, <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, and <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. Proceed thence to <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, and there await the summons of
    your Lord, who will keep watch over you and will direct you to whatsoever is His will and desire. As to Myself, I shall, accompanied by <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and My
    Ethiopian servant, proceed on My pilgrimage to <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark>. I shall join the company of the pilgrims of <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark>, who will shortly be sailing for that land. I shall
    visit Mecca and Medina, and there fulfil the mission with which God has entrusted Me. God willing, I shall return hither by the way of <mark class="term correct">Kúfih</mark>, in which
    place I hope to meet you. If it be decreed otherwise, I shall ask you to join Me in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. The hosts of the invisible Kingdom, be assured, will
    sustain and reinforce your efforts. The essence of power is now dwelling in you, and the company of His chosen angels revolves around you. His almighty
    arms will surround you, and His unfailing Spirit will ever continue to guide your steps. He that loves you, loves God; and whoever opposes you, has opposed
    God. Whoso befriends you, him will God befriend; and whoso rejects you, him will God reject.” <a name="Page_97"></a>CHAPTER IV: <mark class="term misspelled">MULLA</mark><mark class="term correction">MULLÁ</mark><mark class="term correct">ḤUSAYN</mark>’S JOURNEY TO <mark class="term correct">ṬIHRÁN</mark>WITH these noble words ringing in his ears, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> embarked upon his perilous enterprise. Wherever he went, to whatever class of people he addressed
    himself, he delivered fearlessly and without reserve the Message with which his beloved Master had entrusted him. Arriving in <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, he established
    himself in the <mark class="term correct">madrisih</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ním-Ávard</mark>. Around him gathered those who on his previous visit to that city had known him as the favoured messenger of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> to the eminent <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark>.<a href="#_ftn114" name="_ftnref114" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> He, being now
    dead, had been succeeded by his son, who had just returned from <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark> and was now established upon the seat of his father. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ibráhím-i-Kalbásí</mark>
    had also fallen seriously ill, and was on the verge of death. The disciples of the late <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark>, now freed from the restraining
    influence of their departed teacher, and alarmed at the strange doctrines which <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was propounding, vehemently denounced him to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark>, the son of the late <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark>. “<mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>,” they complained, “was able, in the course of his last visit, to win the support
    of your illustrious father to the cause of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>. No one among the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>’s helpless disciples dared to oppose him. He now comes as
    the upholder of a still more formidable opponent and is pleading His Cause with still greater vehemence and vigour. He is persistently claiming that He
whose Cause he now champions is the Revealer of a Book which is divinely inspired, and which bears a striking resemblance to the tone    <a name="Page_98"></a>and language of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>. In the face of the people of this city, he has flung these challenging words: <mark class="term unknown">‘Produce</mark> one like it, if
    you are men of truth.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The day is fast approaching when the whole of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark> will have embraced his Cause!” <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark> returned evasive answers
    to their complaints. “What am I to say?” he was at last forced to reply. Do you not yourselves admit that <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> has, by his eloquence and the
    cogency of his argument, silenced a man no less great than my illustrious father? How can I, then, who am so inferior to him in merit and knowledge,
    presume to challenge what he has already approved? Let each man dispassionately examine these claims. If he be satisfied, well and good; if not, let him
    observe silence, and not incur the risk of discrediting the fair name of our Faith.”
<p></p><p>Finding that their efforts had failed to influence <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark>, his disciples referred the matter to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ibráhím-i-Kalbásí</mark>. “Woe
    betide us,” they loudly protested, “for the enemy has risen to disrupt the holy Faith of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. ln lurid and exaggerated language, they stressed the
    challenging character of the ideas propounded by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. “Hold your peace,” replied <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ibráhím</mark>. “<mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> is not the person to be
    duped by anyone, nor can he fall a victim to dangerous heresies. If your contention be true, if <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> has indeed espoused a new Faith, it is
    unquestionably your first obligation to enquire dispassionately into the character of his teachings, and to refrain from denouncing him without previous
    and careful scrutiny. If my health and strength be restored, it is my intention, God willing, to investigate the matter myself, and to ascertain the
    truth.”
</p><p>This severe rebuke, pronounced by <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Kalbásí</mark>, greatly disconcerted the disciples of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark>. In their dismay they appealed to <mark class="term unknown">Manú</mark>    <u>ch</u>ihr <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamídu’d-Dawlih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamidu’d-Dawlih</mark>, the governor of the city. That wise and judicious ruler refused to interfere in these matters, which he
    said fell exclusively within the jurisdiction of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark>. He warned them to abstain from mischief and to cease disturbing the peace and tranquillity of
the messenger. His trenchant words shattered the hopes of the <mark class="term unknown">mischief-makers</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was thereby relieved from the machinations    <a name="Page_99"></a>of his enemies, and, for a time, pursued untrammelled the course of his labours.
</p>The first to embrace the Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in that city was a man, a sifter of wheat, who, as soon as the Call reached his ears, unreservedly accepted the
    Message. With marvellous devotion he served <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and through his close association with him became a zealous advocate of the new Revelation. A few
    years later, when the <mark class="term unknown">soul-stirring</mark> details of the siege of the fort of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> were being recounted to him, he felt an irresistible
    impulse to throw in his lot with those heroic companions of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> who had risen for the defence of their Faith. Carrying his sieve in his hand, he
    immediately arose and set out to reach the scene of that memorable encounter. “Why leave so hurriedly?” his friends asked him, as they saw him running in a
state of intense excitement through the bazaars of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>. “I have risen,” he replied, “to join the glorious company of the defenders of the fort of    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>! With this sieve which I carry with me, I intend to sift the people in every city through which I pass. Whomsoever I find
    ready to espouse the Cause I have embraced, I will ask to join me and hasten forthwith to the field of martyrdom.” Such was the devotion of this youth,
that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, in the Persian <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark>, refers to him in such terms: “<mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, that outstanding city, is distinguished by the religious fervour of its    <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark> inhabitants, by the learning of its divines, and by the keen expectation, shared by high and low alike, of the imminent coming of the
    <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>. In every quarter of that city, religious institutions have been established. And yet, when the Messenger of God had been made manifest,
    they who claimed to be the repositories of learning and the expounders of the mysteries of the Faith of God rejected His Message. Of all the inhabitants of
that seat of learning, only one person, a sifter of wheat, was found to recognise the Truth, and was invested with the robe of Divine virtue!”    <a href="#_ftn115" name="_ftnref115" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><a name="Page_100"></a>Among the siyyids of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, a few, such as <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alíy-i-Nahrí</mark>, whose daughter was subsequently joined in wedlock with the Most Great Branch,    <a href="#_ftn116" name="_ftnref116" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Hádí</mark>, the brother of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-Riḍáy-i-Pa-Qal’iyí</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-Riḍáy-i-Pá-Qal‘iyí</mark>, recognised the truth of the Cause. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq-i-<u>Kh</u>urásání</mark>, formerly known as <mark class="term correct">Muqaddas</mark>, and surnamed by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>,

way for the advent of the new Revelation, was also among the first believers who identified themselves with the Message proclaimed by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn117" name="_ftnref117" title="">[******************************]</a> As Soon as he learned of the arrival of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, he
    hastened to meet him. He gives the following account of his first interview, which took place at night in the home of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alíy-i-Nahrí</mark>: “I
    asked <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> to divulge the name of Him who claimed to be the promised Manifestation. He replied: <mark class="term unknown">‘To</mark> enquire about that name and to divulge it are
    alike forbidden.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘Would</mark> it, then, be possible,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I asked, <mark class="term unknown">‘for</mark> me, even as the Letters of the Living, to seek independently the grace of the <mark class="term unknown">All-Merciful</mark>
    and, through prayer, to discover His identity?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> door of His grace,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he replied, <mark class="term unknown">‘is</mark> never closed before the face of him who seeks to find Him.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I
    immediately retired from his presence, and requested his host to allow me the privacy of a room in his house where, alone and undisturbed, I could commune
    with God. In the midst of my contemplation, I suddenly remembered the face of a Youth whom I had often observed while in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, standing in an attitude
    of prayer, with His face bathed in tears at the entrance of the shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. That same countenance now reappeared before my eyes. In my
    vision I seemed to behold that same face, those same features, expressive of such joy as I could never describe. He smiled as He gazed at me. I went
    towards Him, ready to throw myself at His feet. I was bending towards the ground, when, lo! that radiant figure vanished from before me. Overpowered with
    joy and gladness, I ran out to meet <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><a name="Page_101"></a><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who with transport received me and assured me that I had, at last, attained the
    object of my desire. He bade me, however, repress my feelings. <mark class="term unknown">‘Declare</mark> not your vision to anyone,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he urged me; <mark class="term unknown">‘the</mark> time for it has not yet arrived. You
    have reaped the fruit of your patient waiting in <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>.

    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was a <mark class="term unknown">well-known</mark> divine, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Báqí</mark>, a resident of <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark> and a member of the <mark class="term correct"><u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í</mark> community. Although
    intimately associated with <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> during his stay in <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> felt unable to sacrifice rank and leadership for the Message which
    his friend had brought him.
<p></p>Arriving in <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> found its people utterly unprepared to heed his call. The seeds he sowed among them did not germinate until the time when
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was exiled to <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>. In those days <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Músá</mark>, a native of <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, embraced the Faith, journeyed to <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>, and there met
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. He eventually quaffed the cup of martyrdom in His path.
<p></p>From <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> proceeded directly to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. He lived, during his stay in the capital, in one of the rooms <a name="Page_102"></a>which belonged to
    the <mark class="term correct">madrisih</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣáliḥ</mark>, better known as the <mark class="term correct">madrisih</mark> of <mark class="term unknown">Pay-i-Minar</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-<u>Kh</u>urásání</mark>, the leader of the <mark class="term correct"><u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í</mark>
    community of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, who acted as an instructor in that institution, was approached by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> but failed to respond to his motivation to accept the
Message. “We had cherished the hope he said to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, “that after the death of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> you would strive to promote the best interests of the    <mark class="term correct"><u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í</mark> community and would deliver it from the <a name="Page_103"></a>obscurity into which it has sunk.

    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, I overheard their conversation from beginning to end, and was deeply affected by the ardour, the fluency, and learning of that youthful
    stranger. I was surprised at the evasive answers, the arrogance, and contemptuous behaviour of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>. That day I felt strongly attracted by
    the charm of that youth, and deeply resented the unseemly conduct of my teacher towards him. I concealed my feelings, however, and pretended to ignore his
    discussions with <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. I was seized with a passionate desire to meet the latter, and ventured, at the hour of midnight, to visit him. He did not
    expect me, but I knocked at his door, and found him awake seated beside his lamp. He received me affectionately, and spoke to me with extreme courtesy and
    tenderness. I unburdened my heart to him, and as I was addressing him, tears, which I could not repress, flowed from my eyes. “I can now see,” he said,
    “the reason why I have chosen to dwell in this place. Your teacher has contemptuously rejected this Message and despised its Author. My hope is that his
    pupil may, unlike his master, recognise its truth. What is your name, and which city is your home?” “My name,” I replied, “is <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, and my
    surname <mark class="term unknown">Mu’allim</mark>. My home is <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, in the province of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>.” “Tell me,” further enquired <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, “is there <mark class="term unknown">to-day</mark> among the family of the late
    <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Buzurg-i-Núrí</mark>, who was so renowned for his character, his charm, and artistic and intellectual attainments, anyone who has proved himself capable of
    maintaining the high traditions of that <a name="Page_105"></a>illustrious house?” “Yea,” I replied, “among his sons now living, one has distinguished
    Himself by the very traits which characterised His father. By His virtuous life, His high attainments, His <mark class="term unknown">loving-kindness</mark> and liberality, He has proved
    Himself a noble descendant of a noble father.” “What is His occupation?” he asked me. “He cheers the disconsolate <a name="Page_106"></a>and feeds the
    hungry,” I replied. “What of His rank and position?” “He has none,” I said, “apart from befriending the poor and the stranger.” “What is His name?”
    “<mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-‘Alí</mark>.” “In which of the scripts of His father does He excel?” “His favourite script is <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>ikastih-nasta’liq</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>ikastih-nasta‘líq</mark>.” “How does He spend His time?”
    “He roams the woods and delights in the beauties of the countryside.”<a href="#_ftn122" name="_ftnref122" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a>
    “What is His age?” “Eight and twenty.” The eagerness with which <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> questioned me, and the sense of delight with which he welcomed every
    particular I gave him, greatly surprised me. Turning to me, with his face beaming with satisfaction and joy, he once more enquired: “I presume you often
    meet Him?” “I frequently visit His home,” I replied. “Will you,” he said, “deliver into His hands a trust from me?” “Most assuredly,” was my reply. He then
    gave me a scroll wrapped in a piece of cloth, and requested me to hand it to Him the next day at the hour of dawn. “Should He deign to answer me,” he
    added, “will you be kind enough to acquaint me with His reply. I received the scroll from him and, at break of day, arose to carry out his desire.
<p></p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘As</mark> I approached the house of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, I recognised His brother <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Músá</mark>, who was standing at the gate, and to whom I communicated the object of my
    visit. He went into the house and soon reappeared bearing a message of welcome. I was ushered into His presence, and presented the scroll to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Músá</mark>,
    who laid it before <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. He bade us both be seated. Unfolding the scroll, He glanced at its contents and began to read aloud to us certain of its
    passages. I sat enraptured as I listened to the sound of His <a name="Page_107"></a>voice and the sweetness of its melody. He had read a page of the scroll
    when, turning to His brother, He said: “<mark class="term correct">Músá</mark>, what have you to say? Verily I say, whoso believes in the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> and recognises its Divine origin, and yet
    hesitates, though it be for a moment, to admit that these <mark class="term unknown">soul-stirring</mark> words are endowed with the same regenerating power, has most assuredly erred in his
    judgment and has strayed far from the path of justice.” He spoke no more. Dismissing me from His presence, He charged me to take to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, as a gift
    from Him, a loaf of Russian sugar and a package of tea,<a href="#_ftn123" name="_ftnref123" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> and to convey to
    him the expression of His appreciation and love.
<p></p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> arose and, filled with joy, hastened back to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and delivered to him the gift and message of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. With what joy and exultation he
    received them from me! Words fail me to describe the intensity of his emotion. He started to his feet, received with bowed head the gift from my hand, and
    fervently kissed it. He then took me in his arms, kissed my eyes, and said: “My dearly beloved friend! I pray that even as you have rejoiced my heart, God
    may grant you eternal felicity and fill your heart with imperishable gladness.” I was amazed at the behaviour of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. What could be, I thought to
    myself, the nature of the bond that unites these two souls? What could have kindled so fervid a fellowship in their hearts? Why should <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, in
    whose sight the pomp and circumstance of royalty were the merest trifle, have evinced such gladness at the sight of so inconsiderable a gift from the hands
    of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>? I was puzzled by this thought and could not unravel its mystery.
<p></p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘A</mark> few days later, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> left for <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. As he bade me farewell, he said: “Breathe not to anyone what you have heard and witnessed. Let
    this be a secret hidden within your breast. Divulge not His name, for they who envy His position will arise to harm Him. In your moments of meditation,
    pray that the Almighty may protect Him, that, through Him, He may exalt the downtrodden, enrich the poor, <a name="Page_108"></a>and redeem the fallen. The
    secret of things is concealed from our eyes. Ours is the duty to raise the call of the New Day and to proclaim this Divine Message unto all people. Many a
soul will, in this city, shed his blood in this path. That blood will water the Tree of God, will cause it to flourish, and to overshadow all mankind.”<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”    <a name="Page_109"></a>CHAPTER V: <mark class="term correct">BAHÁ’U’LLÁH</mark>’S JOURNEY TO <mark class="term correct">MÁZINDARÁN</mark>THE first journey <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> undertook for the purpose of promoting the Revelation announced by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was to His ancestral home in <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, in the province
    of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>. He set out for the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Tákúr</mark><mark class="term correction">Tákur</mark>, the personal estate of His father, where He owned a vast mansion, royally furnished and superbly
    situated. It was my privilege to hear <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> Himself, one day, recount the following: “The late <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, My father, enjoyed a most enviable position
    among his countrymen. His vast wealth, his noble ancestry, his artistic attainments, his unrivalled prestige and exalted rank made him the object of the
    admiration of all who knew him. For a period of over twenty years, no one among the wide circle of his family and kindred, which extended over <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> and
    <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, suffered distress, injury, or illness. They enjoyed, during a long and uninterrupted period, rich and manifold blessings. Quite suddenly, however,
    this prosperity and glory gave way to a series of calamities which severely shook the foundations of his material prosperity. The first loss he suffered
    was occasioned by a great flood which, rising in the mountains of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, swept with great violence over the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Tákúr</mark><mark class="term correction">Tákur</mark>, and utterly destroyed
    half the mansion of the <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, situated above the fortress of that village. The best part of that house, which had been known for the solidity of its
    foundations, was utterly wiped away by the fury of the roaring torrent. Its precious articles of furniture were destroyed, and its elaborate ornamentation
    irretrievably ruined. This was shortly followed by the loss of various State positions which the <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> occupied, and by the repeated assaults directed
    against him by his envious adversaries. Despite this sudden change of fortune, the <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> maintained his dignity and calm, and continued, within the
    restricted limits of his means, his acts of benevolence and charity. He continued to exercise towards his faithless associates <a name="Page_110"></a>Illustrations: APPROACH TO, AND RUINS OF, <mark class="term correct">BAHÁ’U’LLÁH</mark>’S ORIGINAL HOME IN <mark class="term misspelled">TAKUR</mark><mark class="term correction">TÁKUR</mark>, <mark class="term correct">MÁZINDARÁN</mark>] <a name="Page_111"></a>that same courtesy and kindness that
    had characterised his dealings with his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-men</mark>. With splendid fortitude he grappled, until the last hour of his life, with the adversities that weighed
    so heavily upon him.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had already, prior to the declaration of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, visited the district of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, at a time when the celebrated <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>
    <mark class="term unknown">Taqíy-i-Núrí</mark> was at the height of his authority and influence. Such was the eminence of his position, that they who sat at his feet regarded themselves
    each as the authorised exponent of the Faith and Law of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. The <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> was addressing a company of over two hundred of such disciples, and was
    expatiating upon a dark passage of the reported utterances of the <mark class="term correct">imáms</mark>, when <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, followed by a number of His companions, passed by that place,
    and paused for a while to listen to his discourse. The <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> asked his disciples to elucidate an abstruse theory relating to the metaphysical aspects of
    the <mark class="term misspelled">Islamic</mark> <mark class="term correction">Islámic</mark> teachings. As they all confessed their inability to explain it, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was moved to give, in brief but convincing language, a lucid
    exposition of that theory. The <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> was greatly annoyed at the incompetence of his disciples. “For years I have been instructing you,” he angrily
    exclaimed, “and have patiently striven to instil into your minds the profoundest truths and the noblest principles of the Faith. And yet you allow, after
    all these years of persistent study, this youth, a wearer of the <mark class="term correct">kuláh</mark>,<a href="#_ftn124" name="_ftnref124" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a>
    who has had no share in scholarly training, and who is entirely unfamiliar with your academic learning, to demonstrate his superiority over you!
</p>Later on, when <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had departed, the <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> related to his disciples two of his recent dreams, the circumstances of which he believed were of the
    utmost significance. “In my first dream,” he said, “I was standing in the midst of a vast concourse of people, all of whom seemed to be pointing to a
    certain house in which they said the <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark> dwelt. Frantic with joy, I hastened in my dream to attain His presence. When I reached the house, I
    was, to my great surprise, refused admittance. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> promised <a name="Page_112"></a><mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I was informed, <mark class="term unknown">‘is</mark> engaged in private conversation with
    another Person. Access to them is strictly forbidden.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> From the guards who were standing beside the door, I gathered that that Person was none other than
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>.
<p></p>“In my second dream,” the <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> continued, “I found myself in a place where I beheld around me a number of coffers, each of which, it was stated,
    belonged to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. As I opened them, I found them to be filled with books. Every word and letter recorded in these books was set with the most
    exquisite jewels. Their radiance dazzled me. I was so overpowered by their brilliance that I awoke suddenly from my dream.”
<p></p><p>When, in the year <mark class="term unknown">’</mark>60, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> arrived in <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, He discovered that the celebrated <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> who on His previous visit had wielded such immense power had
    passed away. The vast number of his devotees had shrunk into a mere handful of dejected disciples who, under the leadership of his successor, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark>
<mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, were striving to uphold the traditions of their departed leader. The enthusiasm which greeted <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s arrival sharply contrasted with the    <a name="Page_113"></a>gloom that had settled upon the remnants of that once flourishing community. A large number of the officials and notables in that
    neighbourhood called upon Him and, with every mark of affection and respect, accorded Him a befitting welcome. They were eager, in view of the social
    position He occupied, to learn from Him all the news regarding the life of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, the activities of his ministers, and the affairs of his
    government. To their enquiries <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> replied with extreme indifference, and seemed to reveal very little interest or concern. With persuasive
    eloquence He pleaded the cause of the new Revelation, and directed their attention to the immeasurable benefits which it was destined to confer upon their
    country.<a href="#_ftn125" name="_ftnref125" title="">[********************************]</a> Those who heard Him marvelled at the keen interest which a man
    of His position and age evinced for truths which primarily concerned the divines and theologians of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. They felt powerless to challenge the soundness
    of His arguments or to belittle the Cause which He so ably expounded. They admired the loftiness of His enthusiasm and the profundity of His thoughts, and
    were deeply impressed by His detachment and <mark class="term unknown">self-effacement</mark>.
</p>None dared to contend with His views except His uncle <mark class="term misspelled">Azíz</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Azíz</mark>, who ventured to oppose Him, challenging His statements and aspersing their truth. When those
    who heard him sought to silence this opponent and to injure him, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> intervened in his behalf, and advised them to leave him in the hands of God.
    Alarmed, he sought the aid of the <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, and appealed to him to lend him immediate assistance. “O vicegerent of the Prophet of
    God!” he said. “Behold what has befallen the Faith. A youth, a layman, attired in the garb of nobility, has come to <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, has invaded the strongholds of
    orthodoxy, and disrupted the holy Faith of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. Arise, and resist his onslaught. Whoever attains his presence falls immediately under his spell, and is
    enthralled by the power of his utterance. I know not whether he is a sorcerer, or whether he mixes with his tea some mysterious substance that makes every
    man who drinks the tea fall a victim to its charm.” The <a name="Page_114"></a><mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark>, notwithstanding his own lack of comprehension, was able to realise
    the folly of such remarks. Jestingly he observed: “Have you not partaken of his tea, or heard him address his companions?” “I have,” he replied, “but,
    thanks to your loving protection, I have remained immune from the effect of his mysterious power.” The <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark>, finding himself unequal to the task of
    arousing the populace against <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, and of combating directly the ideas which so powerful an opponent was fearlessly spreading, contented himself
    with a written statement in which he declared: “O <mark class="term misspelled">Azíz</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Azíz</mark>, be not afraid, no one will dare molest you.” In writing this, the <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> had, through a
    grammatical error, so perverted the purport of his statement, that those who read it among the notables of the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Tákúr</mark><mark class="term correction">Tákur</mark> were scandalised by its
    meaning, and vilified both the bearer and the author of that statement.
<p></p>Those who attained the presence of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and heard Him expound the Message proclaimed by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> were so much impressed by the earnestness of His
    appeal that they forthwith arose to disseminate that same Message among the people of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> and to extol the virtues of its distinguished Promoter. The
    disciples of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> meanwhile endeavoured to persuade their teacher to proceed to <mark class="term misspelled">Tákúr</mark><mark class="term correction">Tákur</mark>, to visit <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in person, to ascertain from Him the
    nature of this new Revelation, and to enlighten his followers regarding its character and purpose. To their earnest entreaty the <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> returned an
    evasive answer. His disciples, however, refused to admit the validity of the objections he raised. They urged that the first obligation imposed upon a man
    of his position, whose function was to preserve the integrity of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark><mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, was to enquire into the nature of every movement that tended to
    affect the interests of their Faith. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> eventually decided to delegate two of his eminent lieutenants, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abbás</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark>, both
    <mark class="term unknown">sons-in-law</mark> and trusted disciples of the late <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>, to visit <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and to determine the true character of the Message He had
brought. He pledged himself to endorse unreservedly whatever conclusions they might arrive at, and to recognise their decision in such matters as final.    <a name="Page_115"></a>Illustrations: EXTERIOR OF THE ROOM OCCUPIED BY <mark class="term correct">BAHÁ’U’LLÁH</mark> IN <mark class="term misspelled">TAKUR</mark><mark class="term correction">TÁKUR</mark>, <mark class="term correct">MÁZINDARÁN</mark>; INTERIOR OF <mark class="term correct">BAHÁ’U’LLÁH</mark>’S ROOM KEPT IN ITS ORIGINAL CONDITION; EXTERIOR
    OF THE ROOM OCCUPIED BY <mark class="term correct">‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ</mark> IN <mark class="term misspelled">TAKUR</mark><mark class="term correction">TÁKUR</mark>, <mark class="term correct">MÁZINDARÁN</mark>; INTERIOR OF THE ROOM OCCUPIED BY <mark class="term correct">‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ</mark>] <a name="Page_116"></a>On being informed, upon their arrival in <mark class="term misspelled">Tákúr</mark><mark class="term correction">Tákur</mark>, that <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had departed for His winter resort, the representatives of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> decided to leave
    for that place. When they arrived, they found <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> engaged in revealing a commentary on the opening <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, entitled “The Seven Verses
    of Repetition.” As they sat and listened to His discourse, the loftiness of the theme, the persuasive eloquence which characterised its presentation, as
    well as the extraordinary manner of its delivery, profoundly impressed them. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abbás</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás</mark>, unable to contain himself, arose from his seat and, urged by an
    impulse he could not resist, walked back and stood still beside the door in an attitude of reverent submissiveness. The charm of the discourse to which he
    was listening had fascinated him. “You behold my condition,” he told his companion as he stood trembling with emotion and with eyes full of tears. “I am
    powerless to question <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. The questions I had planned to ask Him have vanished suddenly from my memory. You are free either to proceed with your
    enquiry or to return alone to our teacher and inform him of the state in which I find myself. Tell him from me that <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás</mark> can never again return to him. He
    can no longer forsake this threshold.” <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark> was likewise moved to follow the example of his companion. “I have ceased to recognise my
    teacher,” was his reply. “This very moment, I have vowed to God to dedicate the remaining days of my life to the service of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, my true and only
    Master.”
<p></p><p>The news of the sudden conversion of the chosen envoys of the <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> spread with bewildering rapidity throughout the district. It roused the
    people from their lethargy. Ecclesiastical dignitaries, State officials, traders, and peasants all flocked to the residence of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. A considerable
    number among them willingly espoused His Cause. In their admiration for Him, a number of the most distinguished among them remarked: “We see how the people
    of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> have risen and rallied round you. We witness on every side evidences of their exultation. If <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> were also to join them, the triumph of
    this Faith would be completely assured.” “I am come to <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>,” <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> replied, “solely for the purpose of proclaiming the <a name="Page_117"></a>Cause
    of God. I cherish no other intention. If I were told that at a distance of a hundred leagues a seeker yearned for the Truth and was unable to meet Me, I
    would, gladly and unhesitatingly, hasten to his abode, and would Myself satisfy his hunger. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, I am told, lives in <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’adat-Ábád</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sa‘ádat-Ábád</mark>, a village not
    far distant from this place. It is My purpose to visit him and deliver to him the Message of God.”
</p><p>Desirous of giving effect to His words, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, accompanied by a number of His companions, proceeded immediately to that village. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> most
    ceremoniously received Him. “I have not come to this place,” <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> observed, “to pay you an official or formal visit. My purpose is to enlighten you
    regarding a new and wondrous Message, divinely inspired and fulfilling the promise given to <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. Whosoever has inclined his ear to this Message has felt
    its irresistible power, and has been transformed by the potency of its grace. Tell Me whatsoever perplexes your mind, or hinders you from recognising the
    Truth.” <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> disparagingly remarked: “I undertake no action unless I first consult the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>. I have invariably, on such occasions, followed the
    practice of invoking the aid of God and His blessings; of opening at random His sacred Book, and of consulting the first verse of the particular page upon
    which my eyes chance to fall. From the nature of that verse I can judge the wisdom and the advisability of my contemplated course of action.” Finding that
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was not inclined to refuse him his request, the <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> called for a copy of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, opened and closed it again, refusing to reveal the
    nature of the verse to those who were present. All he said was this: “I have consulted the Book of God, and deem it inadvisable to proceed further with
    this matter.” A few agreed with him; the rest, for the most part, did not fail to recognise the fear which those words implied. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, disinclined to
    cause him further embarrassment, arose and, asking to be excused, bade him a cordial farewell.
</p>One day, in the course of one of His riding excursions into the country, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, accompanied by His companions, saw, seated by Me roadside, a lonely
youth. His hair was dishevelled, and he wore the dress of a dervish. By the side of a brook he had kindled a fire, and was cooking his food    <a name="Page_118"></a>and eating it. Approaching him, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> most lovingly enquired: “Tell Me, dervish, what is it that you are doing?” “I am engaged
    in eating God,” he bluntly replied. “I am cooking God and am burning Him.” The unaffected simplicity of his manners and the candour of his reply pleased
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> extremely. He smiled at his remark and began to converse with him with unrestrained tenderness and freedom. Within a short space of time,
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had changed him completely. Enlightened as to the true nature of God, and with a mind purged from the idle fancy of his own people, he
    immediately recognised the Light which that loving Stranger had so unexpectedly brought him. That dervish, whose name was <mark class="term correct">Muṣṭafá</mark>, became so enamoured with
    the teachings which had been instilled into his mind that, leaving his cooking utensils behind, he straightway arose and followed <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. On foot,
    behind His horse, and inflamed with the fire of His love, he chanted merrily verses of a <mark class="term unknown">love-song</mark> which he had composed on the spur of the moment and had
    dedicated to his Beloved. “Thou art the <mark class="term unknown">Day-Star</mark> of guidance,” ran its glad refrain. “Thou art the Light of Truth. Unveil Thyself to men, O Revealer of the
    Truth.” Although, in later years, that poem obtained wide circulation among his people, and it became known that a certain dervish, surnamed Maj<u>dh</u><mark class="term unknown">úb</mark>, and whose name was <mark class="term correct">Muṣṭafá</mark><mark class="term correct">Big-i-Sanandají</mark>, had, without premeditation, composed it in praise of his Beloved, none seemed to be aware to whom it
    actually referred, nor did anyone suspect, at a time when <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was still veiled from the eyes of men, that this dervish alone had recognised His
    station and discovered His glory.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s visit to <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> had produced the most <mark class="term unknown">far-reaching</mark> results, and had lent a remarkable impetus to the spread of the <mark class="term unknown">new-born</mark> Revelation. By His
    magnetic eloquence, by the purity of His life, by the dignity of His bearing, by the unanswerable logic of His argument, and by the many evidences of His
    <mark class="term unknown">loving-kindness</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had won the hearts of the people of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, had stirred their souls, and had enrolled them under the standard of the Faith. Such
    was the effect of words and deeds, as He went about preaching the Cause and revealing its glory to His countrymen in <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, that the very stones and trees of
    that district seemed to have <a name="Page_119"></a>been quickened by the waves of spiritual power which emanated from His person. All things seemed to be
    endowed with a new and more abundant life, all things seemed to be proclaiming aloud: “Behold, the Beauty of God has been made manifest! Arise, for He has
    come in all His glory.” The people of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, when <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had departed from out their midst, continued to propagate the Cause and to consolidate its
    foundations. A number of them endured the severest afflictions for His sake; others quaffed with gladness the cup of martyrdom in His path. <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> in
    general, and <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> in particular, were thus distinguished from the other provinces and districts of Persia, as being the first to have eagerly embraced the
    Divine Message. The district of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, literally meaning “light,” which lay embedded within the mountains of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, was the first to catch the rays of
    the Sun that had arisen in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, the first to proclaim to the rest of Persia, which still lay enveloped in the shadow of the vale of heedlessness,
    that the <mark class="term unknown">Day-Star</mark> of heavenly guidance had at length arisen to warm and illuminate the whole land.
<p></p>When <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was still a child, the <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, His father, dreamed a dream. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> appeared to him swimming in a vast, limitless ocean. His body shone
    upon the waters with a radiance that illumined the sea. Around His head, which could distinctly be seen above the waters, there radiated, in all
    directions, His long, <mark class="term unknown">jet-black</mark> locks, floating in great profusion above the waves. As he dreamed, a multitude of fishes gathered round Him, each holding
    fast to the extremity of one hair. Fascinated by the effulgence of His face, they followed Him in whatever direction He swam. Great as was their number,
    and however firmly they clung to His locks, not one single hair seemed to have been detached from His head, nor did the least injury affect His person.
    Free and unrestrained, He moved above the waters and they all followed Him.
<p></p>The <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, greatly impressed by this dream, summoned a soothsayer, who had achieved fame in that region, and asked him to interpret it for him. This man,
as if inspired by a premonition of the future glory of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, declared: “The limitless ocean that you have seen in your dream, O    <a name="Page_120"></a><mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, is none other than the world of being. <mark class="term unknown">Single-handed</mark> and alone, your son will achieve supreme ascendancy over it. Wherever He
    may please, He will proceed unhindered. No one will resist His march, no one will hinder His progress. The multitude of fishes signifies the turmoil which
    He will arouse amidst the peoples and kindreds of the earth. Around Him will they gather, and to Him will they cling. Assured of the unfailing protection
    of the Almighty, this tumult will never harm His person, nor will His loneliness upon the sea of life endanger His safety.”
<p></p><p>That soothsayer was subsequently taken to see <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. He looked intently upon His face, and examined carefully His features. He was charmed by His
    appearance, and extolled every trait of His countenance. Every expression in that face revealed to his eyes a sign of His concealed glory. So great was his
    admiration, and so profuse his praise of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, that the <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, from that day, became even more passionately devoted to his son. The words spoken by
    that soothsayer served to fortify his hopes and confidence in Him. Like Jacob, he desired only to ensure the welfare of his beloved Joseph, and to surround
    Him with his loving protection.
</p><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, though completely alienated from <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s father, showed his son every mark of
    consideration and favour. So great was the esteem which the <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> professed for Him, that <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Núrí</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">I’timádu’d-Dawlih</mark><mark class="term correction">I‘timádu’d-Dawlih</mark>, who
    afterwards succeeded <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, felt envious. He resented the superiority which <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, as a mere youth, was accorded over him. The seeds of
    jealousy were, from that time, implanted in his breast. Though still a youth, and while his father is yet alive, he thought, he is given precedence in the
    presence of the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>. What will, I wonder, happen to me when this young man shall have succeeded his father?
<p></p>After the death of the <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark> continued to show the utmost consideration to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. He would visit Him in His home, and would address
    Him as though He were his own son. The sincerity of his devotion, however, was very soon put to the test. One day, as he was passing through the village of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Quch-Hisar</mark><mark class="term correction">Qú<u>ch</u>-Hisár</mark>, which belonged to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, <a name="Page_121"></a>he was so impressed by the charm and beauty of that place and the abundance of its water
    that he conceived the idea of becoming its owner. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, whom he had summoned to effect the immediate purchase of that village, observed: “Had this
    property been exclusively mine own, I would willingly have complied with your desire. This transitory life, with all its sordid possessions, is worthy of
    no attachment in my eyes, how much less this small and insignificant estate. As a number of other people, both rich and poor, some of full age and some
    still minors, share with me the ownership of this property, I would request you to refer this matter to them, and to seek their consent.” Unsatisfied with
    this reply, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark> sought, through fraudulent means, to achieve his purpose. So soon as <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was informed of his evil designs, He, with
    the consent of all concerned, immediately transferred the title of the property to the name of the sister of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, who had already
    repeatedly expressed her desire to become its owner. The <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark>, furious at this transaction, ordered that the estate should be forcibly seized, claiming
    that he already had purchased it from its original possessor. The representatives of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark> were severely rebuked by the agents of the sister of
the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, and were requested to inform their master of the determination of that lady to assert her rights. The <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> referred the case to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, and complained of the unjust treatment to which he had been subjected. That very night, the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s sister had acquainted him with the
    nature of the transaction. “Many a time,” she said to her brother, “your Imperial Majesty has graciously signified your desire that I should dispose of the
    jewels with which I am wont to adorn myself in your presence, and with the proceeds purchase some property. I have at last succeeded in fulfilling your
    desire. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, however, is now fully determined to seize it forcibly from me.” The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> reassured his sister, and commanded the <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> to
    forgo his claim. The latter, in his despair, summoned <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> to his presence and, by every artifice, strove to discredit His name. To the charges he
brought against Him, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> vigorously replied, and succeeded in establishing His innocence. In his impotent rage, the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> exclaimed:    <a name="Page_122"></a>“What is the purpose of all this feasting and banqueting in which you seem to delight? I, who am the Prime Minister of the <u>Sh</u><mark class="term unknown">áhin<u>sh</u>áh</mark> of Persia, never receive the number and variety of guests that crowd around your table every night. Why all this extravagance and vanity?
    You surely must be meditating a plot against me.” “Gracious God!” <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> replied. “Is the man who, out of the abundance of his heart, shares his bread
    with his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-men</mark>, to be accused of harbouring criminal intentions?” <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark> was utterly confounded. He dared no reply. Though supported by the
    combined ecclesiastical and civil powers of Persia, he eventually found himself, in every contest he ventured against <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, completely defeated.
<p></p>On a number of other occasions, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s ascendancy over His opponents was likewise vindicated and recognised. These personal triumphs achieved by Him
    served to enhance His position, and spread abroad His fame. All classes of men marvelled at His miraculous success in emerging unscathed from the most
    perilous encounters. Nothing short of Divine protection, they thought, could have ensured His safety on such occasions. Not once did <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, beset
    though He was by the gravest perils, submit to the arrogance, the greed, and the treachery of those around Him. In His constant association, during those
    days, with the highest dignitaries of the realm, whether ecclesiastical or State officials, He was never content simply to accede to the views they
    expressed or the claims they advanced. He would, at their gatherings, fearlessly champion the cause of truth, would assert the rights of the downtrodden,
    defending the weak and protecting the innocent. <a name="Page_123"></a>CHAPTER VI: <mark class="term misspelled">MULLA</mark><mark class="term correction">MULLÁ</mark><mark class="term correct">ḤUSAYN</mark>’S JOURNEY TO <mark class="term unknown"><u>KH</u>URÁSÁN</mark>AS THE <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> bade farewell to the Letters of the Living, He instructed them, each and all, to record separately the name of every believer who embraced the
    Faith and identified himself with its teachings. The list of these believers He bade them enclose in sealed letters, and address them to His maternal
    uncle, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, who would in turn deliver them to Him. “I shall classify these lists,” He told them, “into eighteen sets
    of nineteen names each. Each set will constitute one <mark class="term misspelled">váhid</mark><mark class="term correction">váḥid</mark>.<a href="#_ftn126" name="_ftnref126" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> All these
    names, in these eighteen sets, will, together with the first <mark class="term misspelled">váhid</mark><mark class="term correction">váḥid</mark>, consisting of My own name and those of the eighteen Letters of the Living, constitute
    the number of <mark class="term misspelled">Kull-i-<u>Sh</u>ay’</mark><mark class="term correction">Kull-i-<u>Sh</u>ay</mark>.<a href="#_ftn127" name="_ftnref127" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> Of all these believers I shall make
    mention in the Tablet of God, so that upon each one of them the Beloved of our hearts may, in the Day when He shall have ascended the throne of glory,
    confer His inestimable blessings, and declare them the dwellers of His Paradise.”
<p></p><p>To <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, more particularly, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> gave definite injunctions to send Him a written report on the nature and progress of his activities in <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>,
    in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, and in <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. He urged him to inform Him of those who accepted and submitted to the Faith, as well as of those who rejected and
    repudiated its truth. “Not until I receive your letter from <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>,” He said, “shall I be ready to set out from this city on My pilgrimage to
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark>.”
</p><p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, refreshed and fortified by the experience of his intercourse with <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, set out on his journey to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. During his visit to
that province, he exhibited in an astonishing manner the effects of that regenerating power with which the parting words of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had invested    <a name="Page_124"></a>Illustrations: VIEWS OF THE MOSQUE OF <mark class="term unknown">GAWHAR-<u>SH</u>ÁD</mark> IN MA<u>SH</u>HAD SHOWING PULPIT WHERE <mark class="term misspelled">MULLA</mark> <mark class="term correction">MULLÁ</mark> <mark class="term correct">ḤUSAYN</mark> PREACHED] <a name="Page_125"></a>him.<a href="#_ftn128" name="_ftnref128" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> The first to embrace the Faith in <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> was <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term unknown">Aḥmad-i-Az</mark>    <mark class="term unknown"><u>gh</u>andí</mark>, the most learned, the wisest, and the most eminent among the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of that province. In whatever gathering he appeared, no matter how
    great the number or representative the character of the divines who were present, he alone was invariably the chief speaker. The high traits of his
    character, as well as his extreme devoutness, had ennobled the reputation which he had already acquired through his erudition, his ability and wisdom. The
    next to embrace the Faith among the <mark class="term correct"><u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ís</mark> of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> was <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aḥmad-i-Mu’allim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Aḥmad-i-Mu‘allim</mark>, who, while in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, had been the instructor of
    the children of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. Next to him came <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, whom the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> surnamed <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark>, and then <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-Furú<u>gh</u>í</mark>,
    whose learning was unsurpassed except by that of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>. No one apart from these outstanding figures among the ecclesiastical leaders of <u>Kh</u>
    <mark class="term unknown">urásán</mark> exercised sufficient authority or possessed the necessary knowledge to challenge the arguments of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>.
</p><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct">Báqir-i-Qá’iní</mark>, who, for the remaining years of his life, had established his residence in <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, was the next to embrace the
    Message. The love of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> inflamed his soul with such a consuming passion, that no one could resist its force or could belittle its influence. His
    fearlessness, his unsparing energy, his unswerving loyalty, and the integrity of his life, all combined to make him the terror of his enemies and a source
    of inspiration to his friends. <a name="Page_126"></a>He placed his home at the disposal of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, arranged for separate interviews between him and
    the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, and continued to endeavour, to the utmost of his power, to remove every obstacle that might impede the progress of the
    Faith. He was untiring in his efforts, undeviating in his purpose, and inexhaustible in his energy. He continued to labour indefatigably for his beloved
    Cause until the last hour of his life, when he fell a martyr at the fort of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. In his last days he was bidden by <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, after
    the tragic death of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, to assume the leadership of the heroic defenders of that fort. He acquitted himself gloriously of his task. His home,
    situated in <mark class="term misspelled">Bálá-<u>Kh</u>iyabán</mark><mark class="term correction">Bálá-<u>Kh</u>íyábán</mark>, in the city of <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, is up to the present time known by the name of <mark class="term correct">Bábíyyih</mark>. Whoever enters it can never
    escape the accusation of being a <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>. May his soul rest in peace!
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, as soon as he had won to the Cause such able and devoted supporters, decided to address a written report concerning his activities to the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. In his communication he referred at length to his sojourn in <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>, described the account of his experience with <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>,
referred to the departure of the latter for <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, related the events of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, and informed Him of the success which had attended his own efforts in    <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. In it he enclosed a list of the names of those who had responded to his call, and of whose steadfastness and sincerity he was assured. He
    sent his letter by way of <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>, through the trustworthy partners of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s maternal uncle who were at that time residing in <mark class="term misspelled">Tabas</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabas</mark>. That letter reached
    the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> on the night preceding the <mark class="term unknown">twenty-seventh</mark> day of <mark class="term misspelled">Ramadán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ramaḍán</mark>,<a href="#_ftn129" name="_ftnref129" title="">[*********************************]</a> a
    night held in great reverence by all the sects of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> and regarded by many as rivalling in sacredness the <mark class="term correct">Laylatu’l-Qadr</mark> itself, the night which, in the
    words of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, “excelleth a thousand months.”<a href="#_ftn130" name="_ftnref130" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> The only companion
    of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, when that letter reached Him that night, was <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, with whom He shared a number of its passages.
<p></p>I have heard <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> relate the following: “The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s maternal uncle himself described to me the circumstances <a name="Page_127"></a>attending the
    receipt of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>’s letter by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>: <mark class="term unknown">‘That</mark> night I saw such evidences of joy and gladness on the faces of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> as I am unable to
    describe. I often heard the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, in those days, exultingly repeat the words, “How marvellous, how exceedingly marvellous, is that which has occurred
    between the months of <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádi</mark><mark class="term correction">Jamádí</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Rajab</mark>!” As He was reading the communication addressed to Him by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, He turned to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and, showing him certain
    passages of that letter, explained the reason for His joyous expressions of surprise. I, for my part, remained completely unaware of the nature of that
    explanation.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, upon whom the account of this incident had produced a profound impression, was determined to fathom its mystery. “Not until I met <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
    in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>,” he told me, “was I able to satisfy my curiosity. When I repeated to him the account described to me by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s uncle, he smiled and
    said how well he remembered that <a name="Page_128"></a>between the months of <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádi</mark> <mark class="term correction">Jamádí</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Rajab</mark> he chanced to be in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. He gave no further explanation,
    and contented himself with this brief remark. This was sufficient, however, to convince me that in the city of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> there lay hidden a Mystery which,
    when revealed to the world, would bring unspeakable joy to the hearts of both the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>.”
</p><p>The references in <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>’s letter to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s immediate response to the Divine Message, to the vigorous campaign which He had boldly initiated
    in <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, and to the marvellous success which had attended His efforts, cheered and gladdened the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and reinforced His confidence in the ultimate victory
    of His Cause. He felt assured that if now He were to fall suddenly a victim to the tyranny of His foes and depart from this world, the Cause which He had
    revealed would live; would, under the direction of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, continue to develop and flourish, and would yield eventually its choicest fruit. The
    <mark class="term unknown">master-hand</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> would steer its course, and the pervading influence of His love would establish it in the hearts of men. Such a conviction
    fortified His spirit and filled Him with hope. From that moment His fears of the imminence of peril or danger entirely forsook Him. <mark class="term unknown">Phoenix-like</mark> He
    welcomed with joy the fire of adversity, and gloried in the glow and heat of its flame. <a name="Page_129"></a>CHAPTER VII: THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>’S PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA AND MEDINA
THE letter of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> decided the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to undertake His contemplated pilgrimage to <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark>. Entrusting His wife to His mother, and committing them both
    to the care and protection of His maternal uncle, He joined the company of the pilgrims of <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark> who were preparing to leave <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> for Mecca and
    Medina.<a href="#_ftn131" name="_ftnref131" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> was His only companion, and the Ethiopian servant His
    personal attendant. He first proceeded to <mark class="term correct">Bú<u>sh</u>ihr</mark>, the seat of His uncle’s business, where in former days He, in close association with him, had
    lived the life of a humble merchant. Having there completed the preliminary arrangements for His long and arduous voyage, He embarked on a sailing vessel,
which, after two months of slow, stormy, and unsteady sailing, landed Him upon the shores of that sacred land.<a href="#_ftn132" name="_ftnref132" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> High seas and the complete absence of comfort could    <a name="Page_130"></a>neither interfere with the regularity of His devotions nor perturb the peacefulness of His meditations and prayers. Oblivious of the
    storm that raged about Him, and undeterred by the sickness which had seized His <mark class="term unknown">fellow-pilgrims</mark>, He continued to occupy His time in dictating to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>
    such prayers and epistles as He felt inspired to reveal.
</p>I have heard <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Ḥasan-i-<u>Sh</u>írází</mark>, who was travelling in the same vessel as the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, describe the circumstances of that memorable voyage:
    “During the entire period of approximately two months,” he asserted, “from the day we embarked at <mark class="term correct">Bú<u>sh</u>ihr</mark> to the day when we landed at <mark class="term correct">Jaddih</mark>, the
    port of <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark>, whenever by day or night I chanced to meet either the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> or <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, I invariably found them together, both absorbed in their work. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>
    seemed to be dictating, and <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> was busily engaged in taking down whatever fell from His lips. Even at a time when panic seemed to have seized the
    passengers of that <mark class="term unknown">storm-tossed</mark> vessel, they would be seen pursuing their labours with unperturbed confidence and calm. Neither the violence of the
    elements nor the tumult of the people around them could either ruffle the serenity of their countenance or turn them from their purpose.”
<p></p><p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> Himself, in the Persian <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark>,<a href="#_ftn133" name="_ftnref133" title="">[**********************************]</a> refers to the    <a name="Page_131"></a>hardships of that voyage. “For days,” He wrote, “we suffered from the scarcity of water. I had to content myself with the juice of
    the sweet lemon.” Because of this experience, He supplicated the Almighty to grant that the means of ocean travel might soon be speedily improved, that its
    hardships might be reduced, and its perils be entirely eliminated. Within a short space of time, since that prayer was offered, the evidences of a
    remarkable improvement in all forms of maritime transport have greatly multiplied, and the Persian Gulf, which in those days hardly possessed a single
    <mark class="term unknown">steam-driven</mark> vessel, now boasts a fleet of ocean liners that can, within the range of a few days and in the utmost comfort, carry the people of <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark> on
    their annual pilgrimage to <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark>.
</p>The peoples of the West, among whom the first evidences of this great Industrial Revolution have appeared, are, alas, as yet wholly unaware of the Source
    whence this mighty stream, this great motive power, proceeds—a force that has revolutionised every aspect of their material life. Their own history
    testifies to the fact that in the year which witnessed the dawn of this glorious Revelation, there suddenly appeared evidences of an industrial and
    economic revolution that the people themselves declare to have been unprecedented in the history of mankind. In their concern for the details of the
    working and adjustments of this newly conceived machinery, they have gradually lost sight of the Source and object of this tremendous power which the
    Almighty has committed to their charge. They seem to have sorely misused this power and misunderstood its function. Designed to confer upon the people of
    the West the blessings of peace and of happiness, it has been utilised by them to promote the interests of destruction and war. <a name="Page_132"></a>Upon His arrival in <mark class="term correct">Jaddih</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> donned the pilgrim’s garb, mounted a camel, and set out on His journey to Mecca. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, however, notwithstanding the
    repeatedly expressed desire of his Master, preferred to accompany Him on foot all the way from <mark class="term correct">Jaddih</mark> to that holy city. Holding in his hand the bridle of
    the camel upon which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was riding, he walked along joyously and prayerfully, ministering to his Master’s needs, wholly indifferent to the fatigues of
    his arduous march. Every night, from eventide until the break of day, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, sacrificing comfort and sleep, would continue with unrelaxing vigilance to
    watch beside his Beloved, ready to provide for His wants and to ensure the means of His protection and safety.
<p></p>One day, when the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had dismounted close to a well in order to offer His morning prayer, a roving Bedouin suddenly appeared on the horizon, drew near to
    Him, and, snatching the saddlebag that had been lying on the ground beside Him, and which contained His writings and papers, vanished into the unknown
    desert. His Ethiopian servant set out to pursue him, but was prevented by his Master, who, as He was praying, motioned to him with His hand to give up his
    pursuit. “Had I allowed you,” the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> later on affectionately assured him, “you would surely have overtaken and punished him. But this was not to be. The
    papers and writings which that bag contained are destined to reach, through the instrumentality of this Arab, such places as we could never have succeeded
    in attaining. Grieve not, therefore, at his action, for this was decreed by God, the Ordainer, the Almighty.” Many a time afterwards did the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> on similar
    occasions seek to comfort His friends by such reflections. By words such as these He turned the bitterness of regret and of resentment into radiant
    acquiescence in the Divine purpose and into joyous submission to God’s will.
<p></p>On the day of <mark class="term misspelled">Arafat</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Arafát</mark>,<a href="#_ftn134" name="_ftnref134" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, seeking the quiet seclusion of His
    cell, devoted His whole time to meditation and worship. On the following day, the day of <mark class="term correct">Nahr</mark>, after He had offered the <mark class="term unknown">feast-day</mark> prayer, He proceeded to
    <mark class="term correct">Muná</mark>, where, according to ancient custom, He purchased nineteen lambs of the choicest breed, of which He sacrificed nine in <a name="Page_133"></a>His own
    name, seven in the name of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, and three in the name of His Ethiopian servant. He refused to partake of the meat of this consecrated sacrifice,
    preferring instead to distribute it freely among the poor and needy of that neighbourhood.
<p></p>Although the month of <mark class="term correct"><u>Dh</u>i’l-Hijjih</mark>,<a href="#_ftn135" name="_ftnref135" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> the month of pilgrimage to
    Mecca and Medina, coincided in that year with the first month of the winter season, yet so intense was the heat in that region that the pilgrims who made
    the circuit of <a name="Page_134"></a>the sacred shrine were unable to perform that rite in their usual garments. Draped in a light, <mark class="term unknown">loose-fitting</mark> tunic,
    they joined in the celebration of the festival. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, however, refused, as a mark of deference, to discard either His turban or cloak. Dressed in His
    usual attire, He, with the utmost dignity and calm, and with extreme simplicity and reverence, compassed the <mark class="term misspelled">Ka’bih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ka‘bih</mark> and performed all the prescribed rites
    of worship.
<p></p>On the last day of His pilgrimage to Mecca, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> met <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muhít-i-Kirmání</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥíṭ-i-Kirmání</mark>. He stood facing the Black Stone, when the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> approached him and, taking his
    hand in His, addressed him in these words: “O <mark class="term misspelled">Muhit</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥíṭ</mark>! You regard yourself as one of the most outstanding figures of the <mark class="term correct"><u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í</mark> community and
    a distinguished exponent of its teachings. In your heart you even claim to be one of the direct successors and rightful inheritors of those twin great
    Lights, those Stars that have heralded the morn of Divine guidance. Behold, we are both now standing within this most sacred shrine. Within its hallowed
    precincts, He whose Spirit dwells in this place can cause Truth immediately to be known and distinguished from falsehood, and righteousness from error.
    Verily I declare, none besides Me in this day, whether in the East or in the West, can claim to be the Gate that leads men to the knowledge of God. My
    proof is none other than that proof whereby the truth of the Prophet <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> was established. Ask Me whatsoever you please; now, at this very moment, I
    pledge Myself to reveal such verses as can demonstrate the truth of My mission. You must choose either to submit yourself unreservedly to My Cause or to
    repudiate it entirely. You have no other alternative. If you choose to reject My message, I will not let go your hand until you pledge your word to declare
    publicly your repudiation <a name="Page_135"></a>of the Truth which I have proclaimed. Thus shall He who speaks the Truth be made known, and he that speaks
    falsely shall be condemned to eternal misery and shame. Then shall the way of Truth be revealed and made manifest to all men.”
<p></p><p>This peremptory challenge, thrust so unexpectedly by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> upon <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Muhít-i-Kirmání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥíṭ-i-Kirmání</mark>, profoundly distressed him. He was overpowered by its directness,
    its compelling <a name="Page_136"></a>majesty and force. In the presence of that Youth, he, notwithstanding his age, his authority and learning, felt as a
    helpless bird prisoned in the grasp of a mighty eagle. Confused and full of fear, he replied: “My Lord, my Master! Ever since the day on which my eyes
    beheld You in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, I seemed at last to have found and recognised Him who had been the object of my quest. I renounce whosoever has failed to recognise
    You, and despise him in whose heart may yet linger the faintest misgivings as to Your purity and holiness. I pray You to overlook my weakness, and entreat
    You to answer me in my perplexity. Please God I may, at this very place, within the precincts of this hallowed shrine, swear my fealty to You, and arise
    for the triumph of Your Cause. If I be insincere in what I declare, if in my heart I should disbelieve what my lips proclaim, I would deem myself utterly
    unworthy of the grace of the Prophet of God, and regard my action as an act of manifest disloyalty to <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, His chosen successor.”
</p><p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, who listened attentively to his words, and who was well aware of his helplessness and poverty of soul, answered and said: “Verily I say, the Truth
    is even now known and distinguished from falsehood. O shrine of the Prophet of God, and you, O <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, who have believed in Me! I take you both, in this
    hour, as My witnesses. You have seen and heard that which has come to pass between Me and him. I call upon you to testify thereunto, and God, verily, is,
    beyond and above you, My sure and ultimate Witness. He is the <mark class="term unknown">All-Seeing</mark>, the <mark class="term unknown">All-Knowing</mark>, the <mark class="term unknown">All-Wise</mark>. O <mark class="term misspelled">Muhit</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥíṭ</mark>! Set forth whatsoever perplexes your mind,
    and I will, by the aid of God, unloose My tongue and undertake to resolve your problems, so that you may testify to the excellence of My utterance and
    realise that no one besides Me is able to manifest My wisdom.”
</p><p><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Muhit</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥíṭ</mark> responded to the invitation of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and submitted to Him his questions. Pleading the necessity of his immediate departure for Medina, he
    expressed the hope of receiving, ere his departure from that city, the text of the promised reply. “I will grant your request,” the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> assured him. On My
    way to Medina I shall, with the assistance of God, reveal My answer to your questions. If I meet you <a name="Page_137"></a>not in that city, My reply will
    surely reach you immediately after your arrival at <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. Whatever justice and fairness may dictate, the same shall I expect you to fulfil. <mark class="term unknown">‘If</mark> ye do
well, to your own behoof will ye do well: and if ye do evil, against yourselves will ye do it.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> <mark class="term unknown">‘God</mark> is verily independent of all His creatures.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”    <a href="#_ftn136" name="_ftnref136" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a>
</p><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muhit</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥíṭ</mark>, ere his departure, again expressed his firm resolve to redeem his solemn pledge. “I shall never depart from Medina,” he assured the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>,
    “whatever may betide, until I have fulfilled my covenant with You.” As the mote which is driven before the gale, he, unable to withstand the sweeping
    majesty of the Revelation proclaimed by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, fled in terror from before His face. He tarried awhile in Medina and, faithless to his pledge and
    disregardful of the admonitions of his conscience, left for <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>.
<p></p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, faithful to His promise, revealed, on His way from Mecca to Medina, His written reply to the questions that had perplexed the mind of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muhit</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥíṭ</mark>,
    and gave it the name of <mark class="term unknown">Sahifiyi-i-Baynu’l-Haramayn</mark>.<a href="#_ftn137" name="_ftnref137" title="">[***********************************]</a><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muhit</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥíṭ</mark>,
    who received it in the early days of his arrival in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, remained unmoved by its tone and refused to recognise the precepts which it inculcated. His
    attitude towards the Faith was one of concealed and persistent opposition. At times he professed to be a follower and supporter of that notorious adversary
    of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Karím</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, and occasionally claimed for himself the station of an independent leader. Nearing the end of his days, whilst
    residing in <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, he, feigning submission to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, expressed, through one of the Persian princes who dwelt in <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>, a desire to meet Him.
    He requested that his proposed interview be regarded as strictly confidential. “Tell him,” was <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s reply, “that in the days of My retirement in
    the mountains of <mark class="term correct">Sulaymáníyyih</mark>, I, in a certain ode which I composed, set forth the essential requirements from every wayfarer who treads the path of
    search in his quest of Truth. Share with him this verse from that ode: <mark class="term unknown">‘If</mark> thine aim be to cherish thy life, approach not our court; but if sacrifice be
    thy heart’s desire, come and let others come with thee. For such is the way of Faith, if in <a name="Page_138"></a>thy heart thou seekest reunion with
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá</mark>; shouldst thou refuse to tread this path, why trouble us? Begone!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> If he be willing, he will openly and unreservedly hasten to meet Me; if not, I
    refuse to see him.” <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s unequivocal answer disconcerted <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muhit</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥíṭ</mark>. Unable to resist and unwilling to comply, he departed for his home in
    <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> the very day he received that message. As soon as he arrived, he sickened, and, three days later, he died.
<p></p>No sooner had the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> performed the last of the observances in connection with His pilgrimage to Mecca than he addressed an epistle to the Sherif of that
    holy city, wherein He set forth, in clear and unmistakable terms, the distinguishing features of His mission, and called upon him to arise and embrace His
    Cause. This epistle, together with selections from His other writings, He delivered to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, and instructed him to present them to the Sherif. The
    latter, however, too absorbed in his own material pursuits to incline his ear to the words which had been addressed to him by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, failed to respond to
the call of the Divine Message. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Níyáz-i-Ba<u>gh</u>dádí</mark> has been heard to relate the following: “In the year 1267 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn138" name="_ftnref138" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> I undertook a pilgrimage to that holy city, where I was privileged
    to meet the Sherif. In the course of his conversation with me, he said: <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> recollect that in the year <mark class="term unknown">’</mark>60, during the season of pilgrimage, a youth came to
    visit me. He presented to me a sealed book which I readily accepted but was too much occupied at that time to read. A few days later I met again that same
    youth, who asked me whether I had any reply to make to his offer. Pressure of work had again detained me from considering the contents of that book. I was
    therefore unable to give him a satisfactory reply. When the season of pilgrimage was over, one day, as I was sorting out my letters, my eyes fell
    accidentally upon that book. I opened it and found, in its introductory pages, a moving and exquisitely written homily which was followed by verses the
    tone and language of which bore a striking resemblance to the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>. All that I gathered from the perusal of the book was that among the people of Persia
    a man of the seed of <mark class="term misspelled">Fátimih</mark><mark class="term correction">Fáṭimih</mark> and descendant of the family of <mark class="term correct">Há<u>sh</u>im</mark>, had raised a new call, and was announcing <a name="Page_139"></a>to all people
    the appearance of the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>. I remained, however, ignorant of the name of the author of that book, nor was I informed of the circumstances
    attending that call.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘A</mark> great commotion,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I remarked, <mark class="term unknown">‘has</mark> indeed seized that land during the last few years. A Youth, a descendant of the Prophet and a
    merchant by profession, has claimed that His utterance was the Voice of Divine inspiration. He has publicly asserted that, within the space of a few days,
    there could stream from His tongue verses of such number and excellence as would surpass in volume and beauty the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> itself—a work which it took
    <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> no less than <mark class="term unknown">twenty-three</mark> years to reveal. A multitude of people, both high and low, civil and ecclesiastical, among the inhabitants of Persia,
    have rallied round His standard and have willingly sacrificed themselves in His path. That Youth has, during the past year, in the last days of the month
    of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>a’bán</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>a‘bán</mark>,<a href="#_ftn139" name="_ftnref139" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> suffered martyrdom in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, in the province of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>. They who persecuted Him sought by this means to extinguish the light which He kindled in that land. Since His martyrdom, however, His
influence has pervaded all classes of people.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The Sherif, who was listening attentively, expressed his indignation at the behaviour of those    <a name="Page_140"></a>who had persecuted the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> malediction of God be upon these evil people,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he exclaimed, <mark class="term unknown">‘a</mark> people who, in days past, treated
    in the same manner our holy and illustrious ancestors!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> With these words the Sherif concluded his conversation with me.”
<p></p><p>From Mecca the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> proceeded to Medina. It was the first day of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark>, in the year 1261 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn140" name="_ftnref140" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> when He found Himself on the way to that holy city. As He
    approached it, He called to mind the stirring events that had immortalised the name of Him who had lived and died within its walls. Those scenes which bore
    eloquent testimony to the creative power of that immortal Genius seemed to be <mark class="term unknown">re-enacted</mark>, with undiminished splendour, before His eyes. He prayed as He
    drew nigh unto that holy sepulchre which enshrined the mortal remains of the Prophet of God. He also remembered, as He trod that holy ground, that shining
Herald of His own Dispensation. He knew that in the cemetery of <mark class="term misspelled">Baqí’</mark> <mark class="term correction">Baqí‘</mark>, in a place not far distant from the shrine of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, there had been laid to rest    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aḥmad-i-Ahsá’í</mark> <mark class="term correction">Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í</mark>, the harbinger of His own Revelation, who, after a life of onerous service, had decided to spend the evening of his
    days within the precincts of that hallowed shrine. There came to Him also the vision of those holy men, those pioneers and martyrs of the Faith, who had
    fallen gloriously on the field of battle, and who, with their <mark class="term unknown">life-blood</mark>, had sealed the triumph of the Cause of God. Their sacred dust seemed as if
    reanimated by the gentle tread of His feet. Their shades seemed to have been stirred by the reviving breath of His presence. They looked to Him as if they
    had arisen at His approach, were hastening towards Him, and were voicing their welcome. They seemed to be addressing to Him this fervent plea: <mark class="term unknown">‘Repair</mark> not
    unto Thy native land, we beseech Thee, O Thou Beloved of our hearts! Abide Thou in our midst, for here, far from the tumult of Thine enemies who are lying
    in wait for Thee, Thou shalt be safe and secure. We are fearful for Thee. We dread the plottings and machinations of Thy foes. We tremble at the thought
that their deeds might bring eternal damnation to their souls.” “Fear not,” the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s indomitable Spirit replied: “I am come into this    <a name="Page_141"></a>world to bear witness to the glory of sacrifice. You are aware of the intensity of My longing; you realise the degree of My
    renunciation. Nay, beseech the Lord your God to hasten the hour of My martyrdom and to accept My sacrifice. Rejoice, for both I and <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> will be slain on
    the altar of our devotion to the King of Glory. The blood which we are destined to shed in His path will water and revive the garden of our immortal
    felicity. The drops of this consecrated blood will be the seed out of which will arise the mighty Tree of God, the Tree that will gather beneath its
<mark class="term unknown">all-embracing</mark> shadow the peoples and kindreds of the earth. Grieve not, therefore, if I depart from this land, for I am hastening to fulfil My destiny.”    <a name="Page_142"></a>CHAPTER VIII: THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>’S STAY IN <mark class="term unknown"><u>SH</u>ÍRÁZ</mark> AFTER THE PILGRIMAGE
THE visit of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to Medina marked the concluding stage of His pilgrimage to <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark>. From thence He returned to <mark class="term correct">Jaddih</mark>, and by way of the sea regained
His native land. He landed at <mark class="term correct">Bú<u>sh</u>ihr</mark> nine lunar months after He had embarked on His pilgrimage from that port. In the same <mark class="term correct"><u>kh</u>án</mark>    <a href="#_ftn141" name="_ftnref141" title="">[************************************]</a> which He had previously occupied, He received His friends and
    relatives, who had come to greet and welcome Him. While still in <mark class="term correct">Bú<u>sh</u>ihr</mark>, He summoned <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> to His presence and with the utmost kindness bade him
    depart for <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. “The days of your companionship with Me,” He told him, “are drawing to a close. The hour of separation has struck, a separation
    which no reunion will follow except in the Kingdom of God, in the presence of the King of Glory. In this world of dust, no more than nine fleeting months
    of association with Me have been allotted to you. On the shores of the Great Beyond, however, in the realm of immortality, joy of eternal reunion awaits
    us. The hand of destiny will ere long plunge you into an ocean of tribulation for His sake. I, too, will follow you; I, too, will be immersed beneath its
    depths. Rejoice with exceeding gladness, for you have been chosen as the <mark class="term unknown">standard-bearer</mark> of the host of affliction, and are standing in the vanguard of the
    noble army that will suffer martyrdom in His name. In the streets of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, indignities will be heaped upon you, and the severest injuries will
    afflict your body. You will survive the ignominious behaviour of your foes, and will attain the presence of Him who is the one object of our adoration and
    love. In His presence you will forget all the harm and disgrace that shall have befallen you. The hosts of the Unseen will hasten forth to assist you, and
    will <a name="Page_143"></a>proclaim to all the world your heroism and glory. Yours will be the ineffable joy of quaffing the cup of martyrdom for His
    sake. I, too, shall tread the path of sacrifice, and will join you in the realm of eternity.” The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> then delivered into his hands a letter He had written
to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, His maternal uncle, in which He had informed him of His safe return to <mark class="term correct">Bú<u>sh</u>ihr</mark>. He also entrusted him with a copy of the    <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>asá’il-i-Sab‘ih</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>aṣa’il-i-Sab‘ih</mark>,<a href="#_ftn142" name="_ftnref142" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> a treatise in which He had set forth the
    essential requirements from those who had attained to the knowledge of the new Revelation and had recognised its claim. As He bade <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> His last
    farewell, He asked him to convey His greetings to each of His loved ones in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>.
</p><mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, with feelings of unshakable determination to carry out the expressed wishes of his Master, set out from <mark class="term correct">Bú<u>sh</u>ihr</mark>. Arriving at <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>,
    he was affectionately welcomed by <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, who received him in his own home and eagerly enquired after the health and doings of his beloved
    Kinsman. Finding him receptive to the call of the new Message, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> acquainted him with the nature of the Revelation with which that Youth had already
    fired his soul. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s maternal uncle, as a result of the endeavours exerted by <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, was the first, after the Letters of the Living, to embrace the
    Cause in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. As the full significance of the <mark class="term unknown">new-born</mark> Faith had remained as yet undivulged, he was unaware of the full extent of its
    implications and glory. His conversation with <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, however, removed the veil from his eyes. So steadfast became his faith, and so profound grew his love
    for the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, that he consecrated his whole life to His service. With unrelaxing vigilance he arose to defend His Cause and to shield His person. In his
    sustained endeavours, he scorned fatigue and was disdainful of death. Though recognised as an outstanding figure among the business men of that city, he
    never allowed material considerations to interfere with his spiritual responsibility of safeguarding the person, and advancing the Cause, of his beloved
    Kinsman. He persevered in his task until the hour when, joining the company of the Seven Martyrs of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, he, in circumstances of exceptional heroism,
    laid down his life for Him. <a name="Page_144"></a>The next person whom <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> met in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> was <mark class="term correct">Ismu’lláhu’l-Asdaq</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq-i-<u>Kh</u>urásání</mark>, to whom he entrusted the copy of the <u>Kh</u><mark class="term unknown">asá’il-i-Sab‘ih</mark>, and stressed the necessity of putting into effect immediately all its provisions. Among its precepts was the emphatic injunction of the
<mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to every loyal believer to add the following words to the traditional formula of the <mark class="term correct">a<u>dh</u>án</mark>:<a href="#_ftn143" name="_ftnref143" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> “I bear witness that He whose name is <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Qabl-i-Muḥammad</mark><a href="#_ftn144" name="_ftnref144" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> is the servant of the <mark class="term correct">Baqíyyatu’lláh</mark>.”    <a href="#_ftn145" name="_ftnref145" title="">[*************************************]</a><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark>, who in those days had been extolling from the
    <mark class="term unknown">pulpit-top</mark> to large audiences the virtues of the <mark class="term correct">imáms</mark> of the Faith, was so enraptured by the theme and language of that treatise that he unhesitatingly
    resolved to carry out all the observances it ordained. Driven by the impelling force inherent in that Tablet, he, one day as he was leading his
    congregation in prayer in the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-Naw</mark>, suddenly proclaimed, as he was sounding the <mark class="term correct">a<u>dh</u>án</mark>, the additional words prescribed by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. The
    multitude that <a name="Page_145"></a>heard him was astounded by his cry. Dismay and consternation seized the entire congregation. The distinguished
    divines, who occupied the front seats and who were greatly revered for their pious orthodoxy, raised a clamour, loudly protesting: “Woe betide us, the
    guardians and protectors of the Faith of God! Behold, this man has hoisted the standard of heresy. Down with this infamous traitor! He has spoken
    blasphemy. Arrest him, for he is a disgrace to our Faith.” “Who,” they angrily exclaimed, “dared authorised such grave departure from the established
    precepts of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>? Who has presumed to arrogate to himself this supreme prerogative?”
<p></p><p>The populace <mark class="term unknown">re-echoed</mark> the protestations of these divines, and arose to reinforce their clamour. The whole city had been aroused, and public order was, as
    a result, seriously threatened. The governor of the province of <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Íravání</mark>, surnamed <mark class="term misspelled">Ajudan-Bá<u>sh</u>í</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ájúdán-Bá<u>sh</u>í</mark>, and generally designated
    in those days as <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhib-I<u>kh</u>tiyar</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥib-I<u>kh</u>tíyár</mark>,<a href="#_ftn146" name="_ftnref146" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> found it necessary to
    intervene and to enquire into the cause of this sudden commotion. He was informed that a disciple of a young man named <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>, who had just returned
    from His pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina and was now living in <mark class="term correct">Bú<u>sh</u>ihr</mark>, had arrived in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> and was propagating the teachings of his Master.
    “This disciple,” <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was further informed, “claims that his teacher is the author of a new revelation and is the revealer of a book which he
    asserts is divinely inspired. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq-i-<u>Kh</u>urásání</mark> has embraced that faith, and is fearlessly summoning the multitude to the acceptance of that
    message. He declares its recognition to be the first obligation of every loyal and pious follower of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark> <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>.”
</p><p><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> ordered the arrest of both <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark>. The police authorities, to whom they were delivered, were instructed to bring them
    handcuffed into the presence of the governor. The police also delivered into the hands of <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> the copy of the <mark class="term misspelled">Qayyúmu’l-Asmá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’</mark>, which they had
    seized from <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark> while he was reading aloud its passages to an excited congregation. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, owing to his youthful appearance and unconventional
    dress, was at first ignored by <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who preferred to direct <a name="Page_146"></a>his remarks to his more dignified and elderly companion.
    “Tell me,” angrily asked the governor, as he turned to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark>, “if you are aware of the opening passage of the <mark class="term misspelled">Qayyúmu’l-Asmá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’</mark> wherein the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>
    addresses the rulers and kings of the earth in these terms: <mark class="term unknown">‘Divest</mark> yourselves of the robe of sovereignty, for He who is the King in truth, hath been made
    manifest! The Kingdom is God’s, the Most Exalted. Thus hath the Pen of the Most High decreed!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> If this be true, it must necessarily apply to my sovereign,
    <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, of the <mark class="term correct">Qájár</mark> dynasty,<a href="#_ftn147" name="_ftnref147" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> whom I represent as
    the chief magistrate of this province. Must <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, according to this behest, lay down his crown and abandon his sovereignty? Must I, too,
    abdicate my power and relinquish my position?” <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark> unhesitatingly replied: “When once the truth of the Revelation announced by the Author of these
    words shall have been definitely established, the truth of whatsoever has fallen from His lips will likewise be vindicated. If these words be the Word of
    God, the abdication of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and his like can matter but little. It can in no wise turn aside the Divine purpose, nor alter the sovereignty
    of the almighty and eternal King.”<a href="#_ftn148" name="_ftnref148" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a>
</p>That cruel and impious ruler was sorely displeased with such an answer. He reviled and cursed him, ordered his attendants to strip him of his garments and
    to scourge him with a thousand lashes. He then commanded that the beards of both <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark> should be burned, their noses be pierced, that
through this incision a cord should be passed, and with this halter they should be led through the streets of the city.    <a href="#_ftn149" name="_ftnref149" title="">[**************************************]</a> “It will be an object lesson to the people of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>,”
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> declared, “who will know what the penalty of heresy will be.” <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark>, calm and <mark class="term unknown">self-possessed</mark> and with eyes upraised to heaven, was
    heard reciting this prayer: “O Lord, our God! We have indeed heard the voice of One that called. He called us to the <a name="Page_147"></a>Faith—<mark class="term unknown">‘Believe</mark>
    ye on the Lord your God!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>—and we have believed. O God, our God! Forgive us, then, our sins, and hide away from us our evil deeds, and cause us to die with
    the righteous.”<a href="#_ftn150" name="_ftnref150" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> With magnificent fortitude both resigned
    themselves to their fate. Those who had been instructed to inflict this savage punishment performed their task with alacrity and vigour. None intervened in
    behalf of these sufferers, none was inclined to plead their cause. Soon after this, they were both expelled from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. Before their expulsion,
    they were warned that if they ever attempted to return to this city, they would both be crucified. By their sufferings they earned the immortal distinction
    of having been the first to be persecuted on Persian soil for the sake of their Faith. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">‘Alíy-i-Bastamí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Alíy-i-Basṭámí</mark>, though the first to fall a victim to the
    relentless hate of the enemy, underwent his persecution in <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, which lay beyond the confines of Persia. Nor did his sufferings, intense as they were,
    compare with the hideousness and the barbaric cruelty which characterised the torture inflicted upon <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark>.
<p></p>An <mark class="term unknown">eye-witness</mark> of this revolting episode, an unbeliever residing in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, related to me the following: “I was present when <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark> was being
    scourged. I watched his persecutors each in turn apply the lash to his bleeding shoulders, and continue the strokes until he became exhausted. No one
    believed that <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark>, so advanced in age and so frail in body, could possibly survive fifty such savage strokes. We marvelled at his fortitude when we
    found that, although the number of the strokes of the scourge he had received had already exceeded nine hundred, his face still retained its original
    serenity and calm. A smile was upon his face, as he held his hand before his mouth. He seemed utterly indifferent to the blows that were being showered
    upon him. When he was being expelled from the city, I succeeded in approaching him, and asked him why he held his hand before his mouth. I expressed
    surprise at the smile upon his countenance. He emphatically replied: <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> first seven strokes were severely painful; to the rest I seemed to have grown
    indifferent. I was wondering whether the strokes that followed were being actually applied to my own body. A feeling <a name="Page_148"></a>of joyous
    exultation had invaded my soul. I was trying to repress my feelings and to restrain my laughter. I can now realise how the almighty Deliverer is able, in
    the twinkling of an eye, to turn pain into ease, and sorrow into gladness. Immensely exalted is His power above and beyond the idle fancy of His mortal
    creatures.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark>, whom I met years after, confirmed every detail of this moving episode.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>’s anger was not appeased by this atrocious and most undeserved chastisement. His wanton and capricious cruelty found further vent in the
    assault which he now directed against the person of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>.<a href="#_ftn151" name="_ftnref151" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> He
despatched to <mark class="term correct">Bú<u>sh</u>ihr</mark> a mounted escort of his own trusted guard, with emphatic instructions to arrest the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and to bring Him in chains to    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. The leader of that escort, a member of the <mark class="term unknown">Núsayrí</mark> community, better known as the sect of <mark class="term correct">‘Alíyu’lláhí</mark>, related the following: “Having
    completed the third stage of our journey to <mark class="term correct">Bú<u>sh</u>ihr</mark>, we encountered, in the midst of the wilderness a youth who wore a green sash and a small turban
    after the manner of the siyyids who are in the trading profession. He was on horseback, and was followed by an Ethiopian servant who was in charge of his
    belongings. As we approached him, he saluted us and enquired as to our destination. I thought it best to conceal from him the truth, and replied that in
    this vicinity we had been commanded by the governor of <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark> to conduct a certain enquiry. He smilingly observed: <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> governor has sent you to arrest Me.
    Here am I; do with Me as you please. By <a name="Page_149"></a>coming out to meet you, I have curtailed the length of your march, and have made it easier
    for you to find Me.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I was startled by his remarks and marvelled at his candour and straightforwardness. I could not explain, however, his readiness to
    subject himself, of his own accord, to the severe discipline of government officials, and to risk thereby his own life and safety. I tried to ignore him,
    and was preparing to leave, when he approached me and said: <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> swear by the righteousness of Him who created man, distinguished him from among the rest of
    His creatures, and caused his heart to be made the seat of His sovereignty and knowledge, that all My life I have uttered no word but the truth, and had no
    other desire except the welfare and advancement of My <mark class="term unknown">fellow-men</mark>. I have disdained My own ease and have avoided being the cause of pain or sorrow to
    anyone. I know that you are seeking Me. I prefer to deliver Myself into your hands, rather than subject you and your companions to unnecessary annoyance
    for My sake.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> These words moved me profoundly. I instinctively dismounted from my horse, and, kissing his stirrups, addressed him in these words: <mark class="term unknown">‘O</mark> light
    of the eyes of the Prophet of God! I adjure you, by Him who has created you and endowed you with such loftiness and power, to grant my request and to
    answer my prayer. I beseech you to escape from this place and to flee from before the face of <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the ruthless and despicable governor of
    this province. I dread his machinations against you; I rebel at the idea of being made the instrument of his malignant designs against so innocent and
    noble a descendant of the Prophet of God. My companions are all honourable men. Their word is their bond. They will pledge themselves not to betray your
    flight. I pray you, betake yourself to the city of <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark> in <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, and avoid falling a victim to the brutality of this remorseless
    wolf.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> To my earnest entreaty he gave this answer: <mark class="term unknown">‘May</mark> the Lord your God requite you for your magnanimity and noble intention. No one knows the mystery of
    My Cause; no one can fathom its secrets. Never will I turn My face away from the decree of God. He alone is My sure Stronghold, My Stay and My Refuge.
    Until My last hour is at hand, none dare assail Me, none can frustrate the plan of the Almighty. And when <a name="Page_150"></a>My hour is come, how great
    will be My joy to quaff the cup of martyrdom in His name! Here am I; deliver Me into the hands of your master. Be not afraid, for no one will blame you.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I
    bowed my consent and carried out his desire.”
<p></p><p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> straightway resumed His journey to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. Free and unfettered, He went before His escort, which followed Him in an attitude of respectful
    devotion. By the magic of His words, He had disarmed the hostility of His guards and transmuted their proud arrogance into humility and love. Reaching the
    city, they proceeded directly to the seat of the government. Whosoever observed the cavalcade marching through the streets could not help but marvel at
    this most unusual spectacle. Immediately <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was informed of the arrival of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, he summoned Him to his presence. He received Him with
    the utmost insolence and bade Him occupy a seat facing him in the centre of the room. He publicly rebuked Him, and in abusive language denounced His
    conduct. “Do you realise,” he angrily protested, “what a great mischief you have kindled? Are you aware what a disgrace you have become to the holy Faith
    of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> and to the august person of our sovereign? Are you not the man who claims to be the author of a new revelation which annuls the sacred precepts of
    the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>?” The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> calmly replied: “<mark class="term unknown">‘If</mark> any bad man come unto you with news, clear up the matter at once, lest through ignorance ye harm others, and be
    speedily constrained to repent of what ye have done.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”<a href="#_ftn152" name="_ftnref152" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> These
    words inflamed the wrath of <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. “What!” he exclaimed. “Dare you ascribe to us evil, ignorance, and folly?” Turning to his attendant, he
bade him strike the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in the face. So violent was the blow, that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s turban fell to the ground. <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> of    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, who was present at that meeting and who strongly disapproved of the conduct of <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, ordered that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s turban be replaced
    upon His head, and invited Him to be seated by his side. Turning to the governor, the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> explained to him the circumstances connected with the
revelation of the verse of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had quoted, and sought by this means to calm his fury. “This verse which this youth has    <a name="Page_151"></a>quoted,” he told him, “has made a profound impression upon me. The wise course, I feel, is to enquire into this matter with great
    care, and to judge him according to the precepts of the holy Book.” <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> readily consented; whereupon <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark>
    questioned the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> regarding the nature and character of His Revelation. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> denied the claim of being either the representative of the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>
    or the intermediary between Him and the faithful. “We are completely satisfied,” replied the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>; “we shall request you to present yourself on
    Friday in the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-Vakíl</mark>, and to proclaim publicly your denial.” As <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark> arose to depart in the hope of terminating the
    proceedings, <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> intervened and said: “We shall require a person of recognised standing to give bail and surety for him, and to pledge his
    word in writing that if ever in future this youth should attempt by word or deed to prejudice the interests either of the Faith of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> or of the
    government of this land, he would straightway deliver him into our hands, and regard himself under all circumstances responsible for his behaviour.” <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s maternal uncle, who was present at that meeting, consented to act as the sponsor of his Nephew. In his own handwriting he
wrote the pledge, affixed to it his seal, confirmed it by the signature of a number of witnesses, and delivered it to the governor; whereupon <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>    <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> ordered that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> be entrusted to the care of His uncle, with the condition that at whatever time the governor should deem it advisable,
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> would at once deliver the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> into his hands.
</p><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, his heart filled with gratitude to God, conducted the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to His home and committed Him to the loving care of His revered mother.
    He rejoiced at this family reunion and was greatly relieved by the deliverance of his dear and precious Kinsman from the grasp of that malignant tyrant. In
    the quiet of His own home, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> led for a time a life of undisturbed retirement. No one except His wife, His mother, and His uncles had any intercourse
    with Him. Meanwhile the <mark class="term unknown">mischief-makers</mark> were busily pressing <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark> to summon the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-Vakíl</mark> and to call upon Him to
    fulfil His pledge. <a name="Page_152"></a>Illustrations: VIEWS OF THE <mark class="term correct">MASJID-I-VAKÍL</mark>, <mark class="term unknown"><u>SH</u>ÍRÁZ</mark>.

    resemblance to the character of the late <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. He was extremely reluctant to treat with contumely persons of
    recognised standing, particularly if these were residents of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. Instinctively he felt this to be his duty, observed it conscientiously, and was
    as a result universally esteemed by the people of that city. He therefore sought, through evasive answers and repeated postponements, to appease the
    indignation of the multitude. He found, however, that the <mark class="term unknown">stirrers-up</mark> of mischief and sedition were bending every effort further to inflame the feelings of
    general resentment which had seized the masses. He at length felt compelled to address a confidential message to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, requesting him to
    bring the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> with him on Friday to the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-Vakíl</mark>, that He might fulfil the pledge He had given. “My hope,” he added, “is that by the aid of God the
    statements of your nephew may ease the tenseness of the situation and may lead to your tranquillity as well as to our own.”
<p></p><p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, accompanied by <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, arrived at the Masjid at a time when the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> had just ascended the pulpit and was preparing to
    deliver his sermon. As soon as his eyes fell upon the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, he publicly welcomed Him, requested Him to ascend the pulpit, and called upon Him to address the
    congregation. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, responding to his invitation, advanced towards him and, standing on the first step of the staircase, prepared to address the people.
“Come up higher,” interjected the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>. Complying with his wish, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> ascended two more steps. As He was standing, His head hid the breast of    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark>, who was occupying the <mark class="term unknown">pulpit-top</mark>. He began by prefacing His public declaration with an introductory discourse. No sooner
had He uttered the opening words of “Praise be to God, who hath in truth created the heavens and the earth,” than a certain siyyid known as Siyyidi-    <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>i<u>sh</u>-Parí</mark>, whose function was to carry the mace before the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>, insolently shouted: “Enough of this idle chatter! Declare, now and
    immediately, the thing you intend to say.” The <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> greatly resented the rudeness of the siyyid’s <a name="Page_154"></a>remark. “Hold your peace,”
    he rebuked him, “and be ashamed of your impertinence.” He then, turning to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, asked Him to be brief, as this, he said, would allay the excitement of
    the people. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, as He faced the congregation, declared: “The condemnation of God be upon him who regards me either as a representative of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> or
    the gate thereof. The condemnation of God be also upon whosoever imputes to me the charge of having denied the unity of God, of having repudiated the
    prophethood of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, the Seal of the Prophets, of having rejected the truth of any of the messengers of old, or of having refused to recognise the
    guardianship of <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, the Commander of the Faithful, or of any of the <mark class="term correct">imáms</mark> who have succeeded him.” He then ascended to the top of the staircase, embraced
    the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>, and, descending to the floor of the Masjid, joined the congregation for the observance of the Friday prayer. The <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> intervened
    and requested Him to retire. “Your family,” he said, “is anxiously awaiting your return. All are apprehensive lest any harm befall you. Repair to your
    house and there offer your prayer; of greater merit shall this deed be in the sight of God.” <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> also was, at the request of the
    <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>, asked to accompany his nephew to his home. This precautionary measure which <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark> thought it wise to observe was
    actuated by the fear lest, after the dispersion of the congregation, a few of the <mark class="term unknown">evil-minded</mark> among the crowd might still attempt to injure the person of
    the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> or endanger His life. But for the sagacity, the sympathy, and the careful attention which the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> so strikingly displayed on a number of
    such occasions, the infuriated mob would doubtless have been led to gratify its savage desire, and would have committed the most abominable of excesses. He
seemed to have been the instrument of the invisible Hand appointed to protect both the person and the Mission of that Youth.    <a href="#_ftn153" name="_ftnref153" title="">[***************************************]</a> <a name="Page_155"></a>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> regained His home and for some time was able to lead, in the privacy of His house, and in close association with His family and kinsmen, a life of
    comparative tranquillity. In those days He celebrated the advent of the first <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark> since He had declared His Mission. That festival fell, in that year,
    on the tenth day of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’l-Avval</mark> <mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’l-Avval</mark>, 1261 A.H.<a href="#_ftn154" name="_ftnref154" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a>
</p>A few among those who were present on that memorable occasion in the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-Vakíl</mark>, and had listened to the statements of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, were greatly impressed
    by the masterly manner in which that Youth had, by His unaided efforts, succeeded in silencing His formidable opponents. Soon after this event, they were
    each led to apprehend the reality of His Mission and to recognise its glory. Among them was <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, the nephew of this same
<mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>, a young man who had just attained the age of maturity. The seed implanted in his heart grew and developed, until in the year 1267 A.H.    <a href="#_ftn155" name="_ftnref155" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> he was privileged to meet <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>. That visit
    filled him with enthusiasm and joy. Returning greatly refreshed to his native land, he resumed with redoubled energy his labours for the Cause. From that
    year until the present time, he has persevered in his task, and has achieved distinction by the uprightness of his character and <mark class="term unknown">whole-hearted</mark> devotion to
    his government and country. Recently a letter addressed by him to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> has reached the Holy Land, in which he expresses his keen satisfaction at the
    progress of the Cause in Persia. “I am mute with wonder,” he writes, “when I behold the evidences of God’s unconquerable power manifested among the people
    of my country. In a land which has for years so savagely persecuted the Faith, a man who for forty years has been known throughout Persia as a <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>, has
    been made the sole arbitrator in a case of dispute which involves, on the one hand, the <mark class="term misspelled">Zillu’s-Sulṭán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ẓillu’s-Sulṭán</mark>, the tyrannical son of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and a sworn
    enemy of the Cause, and, on the other, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Fatḥ-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhib-i-Diván</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥib-i-Díván</mark>. It has been publicly announced that whatsoever be the verdict of
    this <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>, the same should be unreservedly accepted by both parties and should be unhesitatingly enforced.” <a name="Page_156"></a>A certain <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Karím</mark> who was among the congregation that Friday was likewise attracted by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s remarkable behaviour on that occasion. What he saw
    and heard on that day brought about his immediate conversion. Persecution drove him out of Persia to <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, where, in the presence of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, he
    continually deepened his understanding and faith. Later on he was bidden by Him to return to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> and to endeavour to the best of his ability to
    propagate the Cause. There he remained and laboured to the end of his life.
<p></p>Still another was <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Rikáb-Sáz</mark>. He became so enamoured of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> on that day that no persecution, however severe and prolonged, was able either
    to shake his convictions or to obscure the radiance of his love. He, too, attained the presence of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>. In answer to the questions which
    he asked regarding the interpretation of the Disconnected Letters of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> and the meaning of the Verse of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, he was favoured with an expressly
    written Tablet revealed by the pen of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. In His path he eventually suffered martyrdom.
<p></p>Among them also was <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Raḥím-i-<u>Kh</u>abbaz</mark><mark class="term correction">Raḥím-i-<u>Kh</u>abbáz</mark>, who distinguished himself by his fearlessness and fiery ardour. He relaxed not in his efforts until the
    hour of his death.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abu’l-Ḥasan-i-Bazzaz</mark><mark class="term correction">Abu’l-Ḥasan-i-Bazzáz</mark>, who, as a <mark class="term unknown">fellow-traveller</mark> of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> during His pilgrimage to <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark>, had but dimly recognised the overpowering majesty of His
    Mission, was, on that memorable Friday, profoundly shaken and completely transformed. He bore the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> such love that tears of an overpowering devotion
    continually flowed from his eyes. All who knew him admired the uprightness of his conduct and praised his benevolence and candour. He, as well as his two
    sons, has proved by his deeds the tenacity of his faith, and has won the esteem of his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-believers</mark>.
<p></p>And yet another of those who felt the fascination of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> on that day was the late <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term unknown">Muḥammad-Bisat</mark>, a man <mark class="term unknown">well-versed</mark> in the metaphysical teachings
    of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> and a great admirer of both <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. He was of a kindly disposition and was gifted with a keen sense of
    humour. He had won the friendship of the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>, <a name="Page_157"></a>was intimately associated with him, and was a faithful attendant at the Friday
    congregational prayer.
<p></p>The <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark> of that year, which heralded the advent of a new springtime, was also symbolic of that spiritual rebirth, the first stirring of which could
    already be discerned throughout the length and breadth of the land. A number of the most eminent and learned among the people of that country emerged from
    the wintry desolation of heedlessness, and were quickened by the reviving breath of the <mark class="term unknown">new-born</mark> Revelation. The seeds which the Hand of Omnipotence had
implanted in their hearts germinated into blossoms of the purest and loveliest fragrance.    <a href="#_ftn156" name="_ftnref156" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> As the breeze of His <mark class="term unknown">loving-kindness</mark> and tender mercy wafted
    over these blossoms, the penetrating power of their perfume spread far and wide over the face of all that land. It diffused itself even beyond the confines
    of Persia. It reached <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> and reanimated the souls of those who were waiting in expectation for the return <a name="Page_158"></a>of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to their
    city. Soon after <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, an epistle reached them by way of <mark class="term correct">Basrih</mark>, in which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, who had intended to return from <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark> to Persia by way of <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>,
    informed them of the change in His plan and of His consequent inability to fulfil His promise. He directed them to proceed to <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark> and remain there
    until the receipt of further instructions. “Should it be deemed advisable,” He added, “We shall request you to proceed to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>; if not, tarry in
    <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark> until such time as God may make known to you His will and guidance.”
<p></p><p>The receipt of this unexpected intelligence created a considerable stir among those who had been eagerly awaiting the arrival of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> at <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. It
    agitated their minds and tested their loyalty. “What of His promise to us?” whispered a few of the discontented among them. “Does He regard the breaking of
    His pledge as the interposition of the will of God?” The others, unlike those waverers, became more steadfast in their faith and clung with added
    determination to the Cause. Faithful to their Master, they joyously responded to His invitation, ignoring entirely the criticisms and protestations of
    those who had faltered in their faith. <a name="Page_159"></a>They set out for <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, determined to abide by whatsoever might be the will and desire of
    their Beloved. They were joined by a few of their companions, who, though gravely shaken in their belief, concealed their feelings. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alíy-i-Nahrí</mark>, whose daughter was subsequently joined in wedlock with the Most Great Branch, and <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Hádí</mark>, the brother of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>,
    both residents of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, were among those companions whose vision of the glory and sublimity of the Faith the expressed misgivings of the evil whisperers
    had failed to obscure. Among them, too, was a certain <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-i-Haná-Sab</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-i-Ḥaná-Sáb</mark>, also a resident of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, who is now serving in the home of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. A
    number of these staunch companions of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> participated in the great struggle of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> and miraculously escaped the tragic fate
    of their fallen brethren.
</p>On their way to <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark> they met, in the city of <mark class="term misspelled">Kangavar</mark><mark class="term correction">Kangávár</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> with his brother and nephew, who were his companions on his previous visit to    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, and who were proceeding to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. They were greatly delighted by this unexpected encounter, and requested <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> to prolong his stay
    in <mark class="term misspelled">Kangavar</mark><mark class="term correction">Kangávár</mark>, with which request he readily complied. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who, while in that city, led the companions of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in the Friday congregational
    prayer, was held in such esteem and reverence by his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> that a number of those present, who later on, in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, revealed their
    disloyalty to the Faith, were moved with envy. Among them were <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád-i-Bara<u>gh</u>ání</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-‘Alíy-i-Haratí</mark>, both of whom feigned
    submission to the Revelation of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in the hope of satisfying their ambition for leadership. They both strove secretly to undermine the enviable
    position achieved by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. Through their hints and insinuations, they persistently endeavoured to challenge his authority and disgrace his name.
<p></p>I have heard <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aḥmad-i-Katib</mark><mark class="term correction">Aḥmad-i-Kátib</mark>, better known in those days as <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark>, who had been the travelling companion of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád</mark> from <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>,
    relate the following: “<mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád</mark> often alluded in his conversation with me to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. His repeated and disparaging remarks, couched in artful
    language, impelled me to cease my association with him. Every time I determined to sever my <a name="Page_160"></a>intercourse with <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád</mark>, I was
    prevented by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who, discovering my intention, counselled me to exercise forbearance towards him. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>’s association with the loyal
    companions of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> greatly added to their zeal and enthusiasm. They were edified by his example and were lost in admiration for the brilliant qualities
    of mind and heart which distinguished so eminent a <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciple</mark>.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> decided to join the company of his friends and to proceed with them to <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>. Travelling alone, at about a <mark class="term correct">farsa<u>kh</u></mark>’s    <a href="#_ftn157" name="_ftnref157" title="">[****************************************]</a> distance in advance of his companions, he, as soon as he
    paused at nightfall to offer his prayer, would be overtaken by them and would, in their company, complete his devotions. He would be the first to resume
    the journey, and would again be joined by that devoted band at the hour of dawn, when he once more would break his march to offer his prayer. Only when
    pressed by his friends would he consent to observe the congregational form of worship. On such occasions he would sometimes follow the lead of one of his
    companions. Such was the devotion which he had kindled in those hearts that a number of his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-travellers</mark> would dismount from their steeds and,
    offering them to those who were journeying on foot, would themselves follow him, utterly indifferent to the strain and fatigues of the march.
</p>As they approached the outskirts of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, fearing that the sudden entry of so large a group of people might excite the curiosity and
    suspicion of its inhabitants, advised those who were travelling with him to disperse and to enter the gates in small and inconspicuous numbers. A few days
    after their arrival, there reached them the news that <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> was in a state of violent agitation, that all manner of intercourse with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had
    been forbidden, and that their projected visit to that city would be fraught with the gravest danger. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, quite undaunted by this sudden
    intelligence, decided to proceed to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. He acquainted only a few of his trusted companions with his intention. Discarding his robes and turban,
    and wearing the jubbih<a href="#_ftn158" name="_ftnref158" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> and <mark class="term correct">kuláh</mark> of the people of <u>Kh</u><mark class="term unknown">urásán</mark>, he, disguising himself as a horseman of <mark class="term correct">Hizárih</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled">Quchán</mark><mark class="term correction">Qú<u>ch</u>án</mark> and accompanied by his brother and nephew, set out at an unexpected hour for the    <a name="Page_161"></a>city of his Beloved. As he approached its gate, he instructed his brother to proceed in the dead of night to the house of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s
    maternal uncle and to request him to inform the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> of his arrival. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> received, the next day, the welcome news that <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> was
    expecting him an hour after sunset outside the gate of the city. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> met him at the appointed hour and was conducted to his home. Several times at
    night did the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> honour that house with His presence, and continue in close association with <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> until the break of day. Soon after this, He gave
    permission to His companions who had gathered in <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, to leave gradually for <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, and there to wait until it should be feasible for Him to
    meet them. He cautioned them to exercise the utmost vigilance, instructed them to enter, a few at a time, the gate of the city, and bade them disperse,
    immediately upon their arrival, into such quarters as were reserved for travellers, and accept whatever employment they could find.
<p></p>The first group to reach the city and meet the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, a few days after the arrival of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, consisted of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alíy-i-Nahrí</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Hádí</mark>,
    his brother; <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím-i-Qazvíní</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád-i-Bara<u>gh</u>ání</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-‘Alíy-i-Haratí</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ibráhím-i-<u>Sh</u>írází</mark>. In the course
    of their association with Him, the last three of the group gradually betrayed their blindness of heart and demonstrated the baseness of their character.
    The manifold evidences of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s increasing favour towards <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> aroused their anger and excited the smouldering fire of their jealousy. In their
    impotent rage, they resorted to the abject weapons of fraud and of calumny. Unable at first to manifest openly their hostility to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, they sought
    by every crafty device to beguile the minds and damp the affections of his devoted admirers. Their unseemly behaviour alienated the sympathy of the
    believers and precipitated their separation from the company of the faithful. Expelled by their very acts from the bosom of the Faith, they leagued
    themselves with its avowed enemies and proclaimed their utter rejection of its claims and principles. So great was the mischief which they stirred up among
    the people of that city that they were eventually expelled by the civil authorities, <a name="Page_162"></a>who alike despised and feared their plottings.
    The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> has in a Tablet, in which He expatiates upon their machinations and misdeeds, compared them to the calf of the <mark class="term unknown">Samírí</mark>, the calf that had neither
    voice nor soul, which was both the abject handiwork and the object of the adoration of a wayward people. “May Thy condemnation, O God!” He wrote, with
reference to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-‘Alí</mark>, “rest upon the Jibt and <mark class="term misspelled">Tá<u>gh</u>út</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭá<u>gh</u>út</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn159" name="_ftnref159" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> the twin idols of this perverse people.” All three
    subsequently proceeded to <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark> and joined forces with <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct">Karím</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, whose designs they furthered and the vehemence of whose
    denunciations they strove to reinforce.
<p></p>One night after their expulsion from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, who was visiting the home of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, where He had summoned to meet Him <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alíy-i-Nahrí</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Hádí</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím-i-Qazvíní</mark>, turned suddenly to the <mark class="term unknown">last-named</mark> and said: “<mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark>, are you seeking the
    Manifestation?” These words, uttered with calm and extreme gentleness, had a startling effect upon him. He paled at this sudden interrogation and burst
    into tears. He threw himself at the feet of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in a state of profound agitation. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> took him lovingly in His arms, kissed his forehead, and
    invited him to be seated by His side. In a tone of tender affection, He succeeded in appeasing the tumult of his heart.
<p></p>As soon as they had regained their home, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark> and his brother enquired of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark> the reason for the violent perturbation which
    had suddenly seized him. “Hear me,” he answered; “I will relate to you the tale of a strange experience, a tale which I have shared with no one until now.
    When I attained the age of maturity, I felt, while I lived in <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, a profound yearning to unravel the mystery of God and to apprehend the nature of His
    saints and prophets. Nothing short of the acquisition of learning, I realised, could enable me to achieve my goal. I succeeded in obtaining the consent of
    my father and uncles to the abandonment of my business, and plunged immediately into study and research. I occupied a room in one of the madrisihs of
    <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, and concentrated my efforts on the <a name="Page_163"></a>acquisition of every available branch of human learning. I often discussed the knowledge
    which I acquired with my <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>, and sought by this means to enrich my experience. At night, I would retire to my home, and, in the seclusion of
    my library, would devote many an hour to undisturbed study. I was so immersed in my labours that I grew indifferent to both sleep and hunger. Within two
    years I had resolved to master the intricacies of Muslim jurisprudence and theology. I was a faithful attendant at the lectures given by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">‘Abdu’l-Karím-i-Iravání</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abdu’l-Karím-i-Íravání</mark>, who, in those days, ranked as the most outstanding divine of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>. I greatly admired his vast erudition, his piety and virtue.
    Every night during the period that I was his disciple, I devoted my time to the writing of a treatise which I submitted to him and which he revised with
    care and interest. He seemed to be greatly pleased with my progress, and often extolled my high attainments. One day, in the presence of his assembled
    disciples, he declared: <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> learned and sagacious <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark> has qualified himself to expound authoritatively the sacred Scriptures of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. He
    no longer needs to attend either my classes or those of my equals. I shall, please God, celebrate his elevation to the rank of a <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> on the morning of
    the coming Friday, and will deliver his certificate to him after the congregational prayer.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“No sooner had <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark> spoken these words and departed than his disciples came forward and heartily congratulated me on my accomplishments. I
    returned, greatly elated, to my home. Upon my arrival I discovered that both my father and my elder uncle, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-‘Alí</mark>, both of whom were greatly
    esteemed throughout <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, were preparing a feast in my honour, with which they intended to celebrate the completion of my studies. I requested them to
    postpone the invitation they had extended to the notables of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> until further notice from me. They gladly consented, believing that in my eagerness for
    such a festival I would not unduly postpone it. That night I repaired to my library and, in the privacy of my cell, pondered the following thoughts in my
    heart: Had you not fondly imagined, I said to myself, that only the sanctified in spirit could ever hope to attain the station of an authoritative
    expounder of the <a name="Page_164"></a>sacred Scriptures of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>? Was it not your belief that whoso attained this station would be immune from error? Are
    you not already accounted among those who enjoy that rank? Has not <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>’s most distinguished divine recognised and declared you to be such? Be fair. Do
    you in your own heart regard yourself as having attained that state of purity and sublime detachment which you, in days past, considered the requisites for
    one who aspires to reach that exalted position? Think you yourself to be free from every taint of selfish desire? As I sat musing, a feeling of my own
    unworthiness gradually overpowered me. I recognised myself as still a victim of cares and perplexities, of temptations and doubts. I was oppressed by such
    thoughts as to how I should conduct my classes, how to lead my congregation in prayer, how to enforce the laws and precepts of the Faith. I felt
    continually anxious as to how I should discharge my duties, how to ensure the superiority of my achievements over those who had preceded me. I was overcome
    with such a sense of humiliation that I felt impelled to seek forgiveness from God. Your aim in acquiring all this learning, I thought to myself, has been
    to unravel the mystery of God and to attain the state of certitude. Be fair. Are you sure of your own interpretation of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>? Are you certain that
    the laws which you promulgate reflect the will of God? The consciousness of error suddenly dawned upon me. I realised for the first time how the rust of
    learning had corroded my soul and had obscured my vision. I lamented my past, and deplored the futility of my endeavours. I knew that the people of my own
    rank were subject to the same afflictions. As soon as they had acquired this <mark class="term unknown">so-called</mark> learning, they would claim to be the exponents of the law of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>
    and would arrogate to themselves the exclusive privilege of pronouncing upon its doctrine.
</p>“I remained absorbed in my thoughts until dawn. That night I neither ate nor slept. At times I would commune with God: <mark class="term unknown">‘Thou</mark> seest me, O my Lord, and Thou
    beholdest my plight. Thou knowest that I cherish no other desire except Thy holy will and pleasure. I am lost in bewilderment at the thought of the
    multitude of sects into which Thy holy Faith hath fallen. I am deeply perplexed when I behold the <a name="Page_165"></a>schisms that have torn the
    religions of the past. Wilt Thou guide me in my perplexities, and relieve me of my doubts? Whither am I to turn for consolation and guidance?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I wept so
    bitterly that night that I seemed to have lost consciousness. There suddenly came to me the vision of a great gathering of people, the expression of whose
    shining faces greatly impressed me. A noble figure, attired in the garb of a siyyid, occupied a seat on the pulpit facing the congregation. He was
    expounding the meaning of this sacred verse of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>: <mark class="term unknown">‘Whoso</mark> maketh efforts for Us, in Our ways will We guide them.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I was fascinated by his face. I
    arose, advanced towards him, and was on the point of throwing myself at his feet when that vision suddenly vanished. My heart was flooded with light. My
    joy was indescribable.
<p></p>“I immediately decided to consult <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Alláh-Vardí</mark>, father of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Javád-i-Farhádí</mark>, a man known throughout <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> for his deep spiritual insight. When
    I related to him my vision, he smiled and with extraordinary precision described to me the distinguishing features of the siyyid who had appeared to me.
    <mark class="term unknown">‘That</mark> noble figure,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he added, <mark class="term unknown">‘was</mark> none other than <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark>, who is now in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> and who may be seen expounding every day to
    his disciples the sacred teachings of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. Those who listen to his discourse are refreshed and edified by his utterance. I can never describe the
    impression which his words exert upon his hearers.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I joyously arose and, expressing to him my feelings of profound appreciation, retired to my home and
    started forthwith on my journey to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. My old <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> came and entreated me either to call in person on the learned <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark>, who
    had expressed a desire to meet me, or to allow him to come to my house. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> feel the impulse,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I replied, <mark class="term unknown">‘to</mark> visit the shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> at
    <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. I have vowed to start immediately on that pilgrimage. I cannot postpone my departure. I will, if possible, visit him for a few moments when I
    start to leave the city. If I cannot, I would beg him to excuse me and to pray in my behalf that I may be guided on the straight path.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“I confidentially acquainted my relatives with the nature of my vision and its interpretation. I informed them of my projected visit to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. My words
    to them that very day <a name="Page_166"></a>instilled the love of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> in their hearts. They felt greatly drawn to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Alláh-Vardí</mark>, freely
    associated with him, and became his fervent admirers.
</p>“My brother, <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd</mark> [who later quaffed the cup of martyrdom in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>], accompanied me on my journey to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. There I met <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> and was
    amazed to hear him discourse to his assembled disciples under exactly the same circumstances as he had appeared to me in my vision. I was astounded when I
    discovered, upon my arrival, that he was expounding the meaning of the same verse which he, when he appeared to me, was explaining to his disciples. As I
    sat and listened to him, I was greatly impressed by the force of his argument and the profundity of his thoughts. He graciously received me and showed me
    the utmost kindness. My brother and I both felt an inner joy we had never before experienced. At the hour of dawn we would hasten to his home, and would
    accompany him on his visit to the shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>.
<p></p>“I spent the entire winter in close companionship with him. During the whole of that period, I faithfully attended his classes. Every time I listened to
    his speech, I heard him describe a particular aspect of the manifestation of the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>. This theme constituted the sole subject of his discourses.
    Whichever verse or tradition he happened to be expounding, he would invariably conclude his commentary on it with a particular reference to the advent of
    the promised Revelation. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> promised One,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he would openly and repeatedly declare, lives in the midst of this people. The appointed time for His
    appearance is fast approaching. Prepare the way for Him, and purify yourselves so that you may recognise His beauty. Not until I depart from this world
    will the <mark class="term unknown">day-star</mark> of His countenance be revealed. It behoves you after my departure to arise and seek Him. You should not rest for one moment until you
    find Him.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“After the celebration of <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> bade me depart from <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. <mark class="term unknown">‘Rest</mark> assured, O <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he told me as he bade me farewell, <mark class="term unknown">‘you</mark> are
    of those who, in the Day of His Revelation, will arise for the triumph of His Cause. You will, I hope, remember me on that blessed Day.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I besought him to
    allow me to remain in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, pleading <a name="Page_167"></a>that my return to <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> would arouse the enmity of the <mark class="term correct">mullás</mark> of that city. <mark class="term unknown">‘Let</mark> your trust
    be wholly in God,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> was his reply. <mark class="term unknown">‘Ignore</mark> entirely their machinations. Engage in trade, and rest assured that their protestations will never succeed in
    harming you.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I followed his advice, and together with my brother set out for <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>.
</p>“Immediately upon my arrival, I undertook to carry out the counsel of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. With the instructions he had given me, I was able to silence every
    malicious opposer. I devoted my days to the transaction of my business; at night I would regain my home and, in the quiet of my chamber, would consecrate
    my time to meditation and prayer. With tearful eyes I would commune with God and would beseech Him, saying: <mark class="term unknown">‘Thou</mark> hast, by the mouth of Thine inspired
    servant, promised that I shall attain unto Thy Day, and shall behold Thy Revelation. Thou hast, through him, assured me that I shall be among those who
    will arise for the triumph of Thy Cause. How long wilt Thou withhold from me Thy promise? When will the hand of Thy <mark class="term unknown">loving-kindness</mark> unlock to me the door
    of Thy grace, and confer upon me Thy everlasting bounty?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Every night I would renew this prayer and would continue in my supplications until the break of
    day.
<p></p>“One night, on the eve of the day of <mark class="term misspelled">Árafih</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Arafih</mark>, in the year 1255 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn160" name="_ftnref160" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> I was so wrapt in prayer that I seemed to have fallen into a
    trance. There appeared before me a bird, white as the snow, which hovered above my head and alighted upon the twig of a tree beside me. In accents of
    indescribable sweetness, that bird voiced these words: <mark class="term unknown">‘Are</mark> you seeking the Manifestation, O <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark>? Lo, the year <mark class="term unknown">’</mark>60.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Immediately after, the bird
    flew away and vanished. The mystery of those words greatly agitated me. The memory of the beauty of that vision lingered long in my mind. I seemed to have
    tasted all the delights of Paradise. My joy was irrepressible.
<p></p>“The mystic message of that bird had penetrated my soul and was continually on my lips. I revolved it constantly in my mind. I shared it with no one,
fearing lest its sweetness forsake me. A few years later, the Call from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> reached my ears. The day I heard it, I hastened to that city. On    <a name="Page_168"></a>my way I met, in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-i-Mu’allim</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-i-Mu‘allim</mark>, who acquainted me with the nature of this Call, and informed me that those who
    had acknowledged it had gathered in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> and were awaiting the return of their Leader from <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark>. I immediately departed for that city. From <mark class="term correct">Hamadán</mark>,
    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád-i-Bara<u>gh</u>ání</mark>, to my great distress, accompanied me to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, where I was privileged to meet you as well as the rest of the believers. I
    continued to treasure within my heart the strange message conveyed to me by that bird. When I subsequently attained the presence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and heard from
    His lips those same words, spoken in the same tone and language as I had heard them, I realised their significance. I was so overwhelmed by their power and
    glory that I instinctively fell at His feet and magnified His name.”
<p></p><p>In the early days of the year 1265 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn161" name="_ftnref161" title="">[*]</a> I set out, at the age of eighteen, from my native village of
    <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark> for <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, where I chanced to meet <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl-i-Zavari’í</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl-i-Zavári’í</mark>, surnamed <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Dh</u>abíh</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Dh</u>abíḥ</mark>, who later on, while in <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>, offered up his life as a
    sacrifice in the path of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. Through him I was led to recognise the new Revelation. He was then preparing to leave for <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> and had
    determined to join the heroic defenders of the fort of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. He had intended to take me with him, together with <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>
    <mark class="term misspelled">Fatḥu’llah-i-Hakkak</mark> <mark class="term correction">Fatḥu’lláh-i-Ḥakkák</mark>, a lad of my age, who was a resident of <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>. As circumstances interfered with his plan, he promised before his departure that he would
    communicate with us from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and would ask us to join him. In the course of his conversation with <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Fatḥu’llah</mark> <mark class="term correction">Fatḥu’lláh</mark> and me, he related to us the account
    of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark>’s marvellous experience. I was seized with an ardent desire to meet him. When I subsequently arrived at <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and met <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>
    <mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl</mark> in the <mark class="term misspelled">Madrisiy-i-Daru’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>afay-i-Masjid-i-<u>Sh</u>áh</mark> <mark class="term correction">Madrisiy-i-Dáru’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>afáy-i-Masjid-i-<u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, I was introduced by him to this same <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark>, who was then
    living in that same <mark class="term correct">madrisih</mark>. In those days we were informed that the struggle of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> had come to an end, and that those
    companions of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> who had gathered in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and were contemplating joining their brethren had each returned to his own province unable to achieve his
    goal. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark> remained in the <a name="Page_169"></a>capital, where he devoted his time to transcribing the Persian <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark>. My close association
    with him at that time served to deepen my love and admiration for him. I still feel, after the lapse of eight and thirty years since our first interview in
    <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, the warmth of his friendship and the fervour of his faith. My feelings of affectionate regard for him prompted me to dwell at length upon the
    circumstances of his early life, culminating in what may be regarded as the turning point of his whole career. May it in turn serve to awaken the reader to
    the glory of this momentous Revelation. <a name="Page_170"></a>CHAPTER IX: THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>’S STAY IN <mark class="term unknown"><u>SH</u>ÍRÁZ</mark> AFTER THE PILGRIMAGE (Continued)
SOON after the arrival of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> at <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, the voice of the people rose again in protest against him. The fear and indignation of the
    multitude were excited by the knowledge of his continued and intimate intercourse with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. “He again has come to our city,” they clamoured; “he again
    has raised the standard of revolt and is, together with his chief, contemplating a still fiercer onslaught upon our <mark class="term unknown">time-honoured</mark> institutions.” So grave
    and menacing became the situation that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> instructed <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> to regain, by way of <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>, his native province of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. He likewise
    dismissed the rest of His companions who had gathered in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, and bade them return to <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>. He retained <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark>, to whom He
    assigned the duty of transcribing His writings.
</p>These precautionary measures which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> deemed wise to undertake, relieved Him from the immediate danger of violence from the infuriated people of    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, and served to lend a fresh impetus to the propagation of His Faith beyond the limits of that city. His disciples, who had spread throughout
    the length and breadth of the country, fearlessly proclaimed to the multitude of their countrymen the regenerating power of the <mark class="term unknown">new-born</mark> Revelation. The
    fame of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had been noised abroad and had reached the ears of those who held the highest seats of authority, both in the capital and throughout the
provinces.<a href="#_ftn162" name="_ftnref162" title="">[†]</a> A wave of passionate enquiry swayed the minds and hearts of both the leaders and the    <a name="Page_171"></a>masses of the people. Amazement and wonder had seized those who had heard from the lips of the immediate messengers of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> the
    tales of those signs and testimonies which had heralded the birth of His Manifestation. The dignitaries of State and Church either attended in person or
    delegated their ablest representatives to enquire into the truth and character of this remarkable Movement.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark><a href="#_ftn163" name="_ftnref163" title="">[‡]</a> himself was moved to ascertain the veracity of these reports and to enquire into
    their nature. He delegated <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Yaḥyáy-i-Darábí</mark><mark class="term correction">Yaḥyáy-i-Dárábí</mark>,<a href="#_ftn164" name="_ftnref164" title="">[§]</a> the most learned, the most eloquent, and the most
    influential of his subjects, to interview the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and to report to him the results of his investigations. The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> had implicit confidence in his
    impartiality, in his competence and profound spiritual insight. He occupied a position of such <mark class="term unknown">pre-eminence</mark> among the leading figures in Persia that at
    whatever meeting he happened to be present, no matter how great the number of the ecclesiastical leaders who attended it, he was invariably its chief
    speaker. None would dare to assert his views in his presence. They all reverently observed silence before him; all testified to his sagacity, his
    unsurpassed knowledge and mature wisdom. <a name="Page_172"></a>In those days <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark> was residing in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> in the house of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Lutf-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correction">Luṭf-‘Alí</mark>, the Master of Ceremonies to the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, as the honoured guest of
his Imperial Majesty. The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> confidentially signified through <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Lutf-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correction">Luṭf-‘Alí</mark> his desire and pleasure that <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark> should proceed to    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> and investigate the matter in person. “Tell him from us, commanded the sovereign, “that inasmuch as we repose the utmost confidence in his
integrity, and admire his moral and intellectual standards, and regard him as the most suitable among the divines of our realm, we expect him to proceed to    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, to enquire thoroughly into the episode of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>, and to inform us of the results of his investigations; We shall then know what
    measures it behoves us to take.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark> had been himself desirous of obtaining <mark class="term unknown">first-hand</mark> knowledge of the claims of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, but had been unable, owing to adverse circumstances, to
    undertake the journey to <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark>. The message of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> decided him to carry out his <mark class="term unknown">long-cherished</mark> intention. Assuring his sovereign of his
    readiness to comply with his wish, he immediately set out for <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>.
</p>On his way, he conceived the various questions which he thought he would submit to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. Upon the replies which the latter gave to these questions
    would, in his view, depend the truth and validity of His mission. Upon his arrival at <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, he met <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, surnamed <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark>,
    with whom he had been intimately associated while in <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. He asked him whether he was satisfied with his interview with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. “You should
    meet Him,” <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark> replied, “and seek independently to acquaint yourself with His Mission. As a friend, I would advise you to exercise the utmost
    consideration <a name="Page_173"></a>in your conversations with Him, lest you, too, in the end should be obliged to deplore any act of discourtesy towards
    Him.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark> met the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> at the home of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, and exercised in his attitude towards Him the courtesy which <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark> had counselled him to
    observe. For about two hours he directed the attention of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to the most abstruse and bewildering themes in the metaphysical teachings of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, to
    the obscurest passages of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, and to the mysterious traditions and prophecies of the <mark class="term correct">imáms</mark> of the Faith. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> at first listened to his learned
    references to the law and prophecies of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, noted all his questions, and began to give to each a brief but persuasive reply. The conciseness and
    lucidity of His answers excited the wonder and admiration of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark>. He was overpowered by a sense of humiliation at his own presumptuousness and
    pride. His sense of superiority completely vanished. As he arose to depart, he addressed the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in these words: “Please God, I shall, in the course of my
    next audience with You, submit the rest of my questions and with them shall conclude my enquiry.” As soon as he retired, he joined <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark>, to whom he related
    the account of his interview. “I have in His presence,” he told him, “expatiated unduly upon my own learning. He was able in a few words to answer my
    questions and to resolve my perplexities. I felt so abased before Him that I hurriedly begged leave to retire.” <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark> reminded him of his counsel, and
    begged him not to forget this time the advice he had given him.
</p>In the course of his second interview, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark>, to his amazement, discovered that all the questions which he had intended to submit to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had
    vanished from his memory. He contented himself with matters that seemed irrelevant to the object of his enquiry. He soon found, to his still greater
    surprise, that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was answering, with the same lucidity and conciseness that had characterised His previous replies, those same questions which he had
    momentarily forgotten. “I seemed to have fallen fast asleep,” he later observed. “His words, His answers to questions which I had forgotten to ask,
    reawakened me. A voice still kept whispering in my ear: <mark class="term unknown">‘Might</mark> not this, after all, have <a name="Page_174"></a>been an accidental coincidence?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I was too
    agitated to collect my thoughts. I again begged leave to retire. <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark>, whom I subsequently met, received me with cold indifference, and sternly remarked:
    <mark class="term unknown">‘Would</mark> that schools had been utterly abolished, and that neither of us had entered one! Through our <mark class="term unknown">little-mindedness</mark> and conceit, we are withholding from
    ourselves the redeeming grace of God, and are causing pain to Him who is the Fountain thereof. Will you not this time beseech God to grant that you may be
    enabled to attain His presence with becoming humility and detachment, that perchance He may graciously relieve you from the oppression of uncertainty and
    doubt?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“I resolved that in my third interview with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> I would in my inmost heart request Him to reveal for me a commentary on the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Kaw<u>th</u>ar</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn165" name="_ftnref165" title="">[**]</a> I determined not to breathe that request in His presence. Should he, unasked by me, reveal this
    commentary in a manner that would immediately distinguish it in my eyes from the prevailing standards current among the commentators on the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, I then
    would be convinced of the Divine character of His Mission, and would readily embrace His Cause. If not, I would refuse to acknowledge Him. As soon as I was
    ushered into His presence, a sense of fear, for which I could not account, suddenly seized me. My limbs quivered as I beheld His face. I, who on repeated
    occasions had been introduced into the presence of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and had never discovered the slightest trace of timidity in myself, was now so awed and
    shaken that I could not remain standing on my feet. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, beholding my plight, arose from His seat, advanced towards me, and, taking hold of my hand,
    seated me beside Him. <mark class="term unknown">‘Seek</mark> from Me,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He said, <mark class="term unknown">‘whatever</mark> is your heart’s desire. I will readily reveal it to you.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I was speechless with wonder. Like a
    babe that can neither understand nor speak, I felt powerless to respond. He smiled as He gazed at me and said: <mark class="term unknown">‘Were</mark> I to reveal for you the commentary on
    the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Kaw<u>th</u>ar</mark>, would you acknowledge that My words are born of the Spirit of God? Would you recognise that My utterance can in no wise be
    associated with sorcery or magic?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Tears flowed from my eyes as I heard Him speak these words. <a name="Page_175"></a>All I was able to utter was this
    verse of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>: <mark class="term unknown">‘O</mark> our Lord, with ourselves have we dealt unjustly: if Thou forgive us not and have not pity on us, we shall surely be of those who
    perish.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
</p><p>“It was still early in the afternoon when the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> requested <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> to bring His <mark class="term unknown">pen-case</mark> and some paper. He then started to reveal His
    commentary on the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Kaw<u>th</u>ar</mark>. How am I to describe this scene of inexpressible majesty? Verses streamed from His pen with a rapidity that was
    truly astounding. The incredible swiftness of His writing,<a href="#_ftn166" name="_ftnref166" title="">[††]</a> the soft and gentle murmur of His voice,
    and the stupendous force of His style, amazed and bewildered me. He continued in this manner until the approach of sunset. He did not pause until the
    entire commentary of the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> was completed. He then laid down His pen and asked for tea. Soon after, He began to read it aloud in my presence. My heart
leaped madly as I heard Him pour out, in accents of unutterable sweetness, those treasures enshrined in that sublime commentary.    <a href="#_ftn167" name="_ftnref167" title="">[‡‡]</a> I was so entranced by its beauty that three times over I was on the verge of fainting. He sought to
    revive my failing strength with a few drops of <mark class="term unknown">rose-water</mark> which He caused to be sprinkled on my face. This <a name="Page_176"></a>restored my vigour and
    enabled me to follow His reading to the end.
</p>“When He had completed His recital, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> arose to depart. He entrusted me, as He left, to the care of His maternal uncle. <mark class="term unknown">‘He</mark> is to be your guest,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He
    told him, <mark class="term unknown">‘until</mark> the time when he, in collaboration with <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark>, shall have finished transcribing this newly revealed commentary, and shall
    have verified the correctness of the transcribed copy.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark> and I devoted three days and three nights to this work. We would in turn read
    aloud to each other a portion of the commentary until the whole of it had been transcribed. We verified all the traditions in the text and found them to be
    entirely accurate. Such was the state of certitude to which I had attained that if all the powers of the earth were to be leagued against me they would be
    powerless to shake my confidence in the greatness of His Cause.<a href="#_ftn168" name="_ftnref168" title="">[§§]</a><p></p>“As I had, since my arrival at <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, been living in the home of <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the governor of <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark>, I felt that my prolonged absence from
    his house might excite his suspicion and inflame his anger. I therefore determined to take leave of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark> and to
    regain the residence of the governor. On my arrival I found that <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who in the meantime had been searching for me, was eager to know
    whether I had fallen a victim to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s magic influence. <mark class="term unknown">‘No</mark> one but God,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I replied, <mark class="term unknown">‘who</mark> alone can change the hearts of men, is able to captivate the
    heart of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark>. Whoso can ensnare his heart is of God, and His word unquestionably the voice of Truth.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> My answer silenced the governor. In his
    conversation with others, I subsequently learned, he had expressed the view that I too had fallen a hopeless victim to the charm of that Youth. He had even
    written to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and complained that during my stay in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> I had refused all manner of intercourse with the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of the city.
    <mark class="term unknown">‘Though</mark> nominally my guest,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he wrote to his sovereign, <mark class="term unknown">‘he</mark> frequently <a name="Page_177"></a>absents himself for a number of consecutive days and nights
    from my house. That he has become a <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>, that he has been heart and soul enslaved by the will of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>, I have ceased to entertain any doubt.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“<mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> himself, at one of the state functions in his capital, was reported to have addressed these words to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>: <mark class="term unknown">‘We</mark> have been
    lately informed<a href="#_ftn169" name="_ftnref169" title="">[***]</a> that <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Yaḥyáy-i-Darábí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Yaḥyáy-i-Dárábí</mark> has become a <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>. If this be true, it behoves us to
    cease belittling the cause of that siyyid.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, on his part, received the following imperial command: <mark class="term unknown">‘It</mark> is strictly forbidden to any one
    of our subjects to utter such words as would tend to detract from the exalted rank of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Yaḥyáy-i-Darábí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Yaḥyáy-i-Dárábí</mark>. He is of noble lineage, a man of great
    learning, of perfect and consummate virtue. He will under no circumstances incline his ear to any cause unless he believes it to be conducive to the
    advancement of the best interests of our realm and to the <mark class="term unknown">well-being</mark> of the Faith of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
</p><p>“Upon the receipt of this imperial injunction, <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, unable to resist me openly, strove privily to undermine my authority. His face betrayed
    an implacable enmity and hate. He failed, however, in view of the marked favours bestowed upon me by the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, either to harm my person or to
    discredit my name.
</p>“I was subsequently commanded by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to journey to <mark class="term correct">Burújird</mark>, and there acquaint my father<a href="#_ftn170" name="_ftnref170" title="">[†††]</a> with
    the new Message. He urged me to exercise towards him the utmost forbearance and consideration. From my confidential conversations with him I gathered that
    he was unwilling to repudiate the truth of the Message I had brought him. He preferred, however, to be left alone and to be allowed to pursue his own way.”
<p></p><p>Another dignitary of the realm who dispassionately investigated and ultimately embraced the Message of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> <a name="Page_178"></a>was <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>,<a href="#_ftn171" name="_ftnref171" title="">[‡‡‡]</a> a native of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, whom the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> surnamed <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat-i-Zanjání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat-i-Zanjání</mark>. He was a man of
    independent mind, noted for extreme originality and freedom from all forms of traditional restraint. He denounced the whole hierarchy of the ecclesiastical
    leaders of his country, from the <mark class="term misspelled">Abváb-i-Arbá’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Abváb-i-Arba‘ih</mark><a href="#_ftn172" name="_ftnref172" title="">[§§§]</a> down to the humblest <mark class="term correct">mullá</mark> among his
    contemporaries. He despised their character, deplored their degeneracy, and expatiated upon their vices. He even, prior to his conversion, betrayed an
attitude of careless contempt for <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aḥmad-i-Ahsá’í</mark> <mark class="term correction">Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn173" name="_ftnref173" title="">[****]</a> He was so filled with horror at the misdeeds that had stained the history of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark> <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>
    that whoever belonged to that sect, no matter how high his personal attainments, was regarded by him as unworthy of his consideration. Not infrequently did
    cases of fierce controversy arise between him and the divines of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> which, but for the personal intervention of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, would have led to
    grave disorder and bloodshed. He was eventually summoned to the capital and, in the presence of his opponents, representatives of the ecclesiastical heads
    of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and other cities, was called upon to vindicate his claim. <mark class="term unknown">Single-handed</mark> and alone he would establish his superiority over his adversaries and
    would silence their clamour. Although in their hearts they dissented from his views and condemned his conduct, they were compelled to acknowledge outwardly
    his authority and to confirm his opinion.
</p>As soon as the Call from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> reached his ears, <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> deputed one of his disciples, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Iskandar</mark>, in whom he reposed the fullest confidence, to
    enquire into the whole matter and to report to him the result of his investigations. Utterly indifferent to the praise and censure of his countrymen, whose
    integrity he suspected and whose judgment he disdained, he sent his delegate to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> with explicit instructions to conduct a minute and
independent enquiry. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Iskandar</mark> attained the presence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and felt immediately the regenerating power of His influence. He tarried    <a name="Page_179"></a>forty days in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, during which time he imbibed the principles of the Faith and acquired, according to his capacity, a
    knowledge of the measure of its glory.
<p></p>With the approval of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, he returned to <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>. He arrived at a time when all the leading <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of the city had assembled in the presence of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>.
    As soon as he appeared, <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> enquired whether he believed in, or rejected, the new Revelation. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Iskandar</mark> submitted the writings of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> which he
    had brought with him, and asserted that whatever should be the verdict of his master, the same would he deem it his obligation to follow. “What!” angrily
    exclaimed <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>. “But for the presence of this distinguished company; I would have chastised you severely. How dare you consider matters of belief to be
    dependent upon the approbation or rejection of others?” Receiving from the hand of his messenger the copy of the <mark class="term misspelled">Qayyúmu’l-Asmá</mark><mark class="term correction">Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’</mark>, he, as soon as he had
    perused a page of that book, fell prostrate upon the ground and exclaimed “I bear witness that these words which I have read proceed from the same Source
    as that of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>. Whoso has recognised the truth of that sacred Book must needs testify to the Divine origin of these words, and must needs submit to
    the precepts inculcated by their Author. I take you, members of this assembly, as my witnesses: I pledge such allegiance to the Author of this Revelation
    that should He ever pronounce the night to be the day, and declare the sun to be a shadow, I would unreservedly submit to His judgment, and would regard
    His verdict as the voice of Truth. Whoso denies Him, him will I regard as the repudiator of God Himself.” With these words he terminated the proceedings of
    that gathering.<a href="#_ftn174" name="_ftnref174" title="">[††††]</a><p></p>We have, in the preceding pages, referred to the expulsion of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark> from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, and have attempted to describe, however
    inadequately, the chastisement inflicted upon them by the tyrannical and rapacious <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><a name="Page_180"></a><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. A word should now be said
    regarding the nature of their activities after their expulsion from that city. For a few days they continued to journey together, after which they
    separated, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> departing for <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark> in order to interview <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Karím</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark> directing his steps towards <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark> with the
    intention of pursuing among the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of that province the work which he had been so cruelly forced to abandon in <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> was received, upon his
    arrival, at the home of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term unknown">Javád-i-Kirmání</mark>, whom he had known in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> and whose scholarship, skill, and competence were universally recognised
    by the people of <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark>. At all the gatherings held in his home, he invariably assigned to his youthful guest the seat of honour and treated him with
extreme deference and courtesy. So marked a preference for so young and seemingly mediocre a person kindled the envy of the disciples of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Karím</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who, describing in vivid and exaggerated language the honours which were being lavished upon <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, sought to excite the dormant hostility of
    their chief. “Behold,” they whispered in his ears, “he who is the best beloved, the trusted and most intimate companion of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>, is now the
    honoured guest of one who is admittedly the most powerful inhabitant of <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark>. If he be allowed to live in close companionship with <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád</mark>, he
    will no doubt instil his poison into his soul, and will fashion him as the instrument whereby he will succeed in disrupting your authority and in
    extinguishing your fame.” Alarmed by these evil whisperings, the cowardly <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Karím</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> appealed to the governor and induced him to call in
    person upon <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád</mark> and demand that he terminate that dangerous association. The representations of the governor inflamed the wrath of the
    intemperate <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád</mark>. “How often,” he violently protested, “have I advised you <a name="Page_181"></a>to ignore the whisperings of this evil
    plotter! My forbearance has emboldened him. Let him beware lest he overstep his bounds. Does he desire to usurp my position? Is he not the man who receives
    into his home thousands of abject and ignoble people and overwhelms them with servile flattery? Has he not, again and again, striven to exalt the ungodly
    and to silence the innocent? Has he not, year after year, by reinforcing the hand of the <mark class="term unknown">evil-doer</mark>, sought to ally himself with him and gratify his carnal
    desires? Does he not until this day persist in uttering his blasphemies against all that is pure and holy in <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>? My silence seems to have added to his
    temerity and insolence. He gives himself the liberty of committing the foulest deeds, and refuses to allow me to receive and honour in my own home a man of
    such integrity, such learning and nobleness. Should he refuse to desist from his practice, let him be warned that the worst elements of the city will, at
    my instigation, expel him from <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark>.” Disconcerted by such vehement denunciations, the governor apologised for his action. Ere he retired, he assured
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád</mark> that he need entertain no fear, that he himself would endeavour to awaken <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Karím</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> to the folly of his behaviour, and
    would induce him to repent.
<p></p>The siyyid’s message stung <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Karím</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. Convulsed by a feeling of intense resentment which he could neither suppress nor gratify, he
    relinquished all hopes of acquiring the undisputed leadership of the people of <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark>. That open challenge sounded the <mark class="term unknown">death-knell</mark> of his cherished
    ambitions.
<p></p>In the privacy of his home, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád</mark> heard <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> recount all the details of his activities from the day of his departure from <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> until his
    arrival at <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark>. The circumstances of his conversion and his subsequent pilgrimage with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> stirred the imagination and kindled the flame of faith in
    the heart of his host, who preferred, however, to conceal his belief, in the hope of being able to guard more effectively the interests of the newly
established community. “Your noble resolve,” <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> lovingly assured him, “will in itself be regarded as a notable service rendered to the    <a name="Page_182"></a>Cause of God. The Almighty will reinforce your efforts and will establish for all time your ascendancy over your opponents.”
<p></p><p>The incident was related to me by a certain <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term unknown">‘Abdu’lláh-i-<u>Gh</u>awgka</mark>, who, while in <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark>, had heard it from the lips of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Javád</mark>
    himself. The sincerity of the expressed intentions of the siyyid has been fully vindicated by the splendid manner in which, as a result of his endeavours,
    he succeeded in resisting the encroachments of the insidious <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Karím</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who, had he remained unchallenged, would have caused
    incalculable harm to the Faith.
</p>From <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> decided to leave for <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>, and from thence to proceed to <mark class="term correct">Ardikán</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Nayin</mark><mark class="term correction">Náyin</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ardistán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. In each of
    these cities, notwithstanding the obstacles that beset his path, he succeeded in instilling into the understanding of his hearers the principles which he
    had so bravely risen to advocate. I have <a name="Page_183"></a>heard <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark>, the brother of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, describe in the following terms his meeting
    with <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>: “The charm of his person, his extreme affability, combined with a dignity of bearing, appealed to even the most careless observer.
    Whoever was intimately associated with him was seized with an insatiable admiration for the charm of that youth. We watched him one day perform his
    ablutions, and were struck by the gracefulness which distinguished him from the rest of the worshippers in the performance of so ordinary a rite. He
    seemed, in our eyes, to be the very incarnation of purity and grace.”
<p></p><p>In <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> was admitted into the presence of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> after which he proceeded to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, where, in his native town of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark> <mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>, in
    the home of his father, he lived for about two years, during which time he was surrounded by the loving devotion of his family and kindred. His father had
    married, on the death of his first wife, a lady who treated <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> with a kindness and care that no mother could have hoped to surpass. She longed to
    witness his wedding, and was often heard to express her fears lest she should have to carry with her to the grave the “supreme joy of her heart.” “The day
    of my wedding,” <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> observed, “is not yet come. That day will be unspeakably glorious. Not within the confines of this house, but out in the open air,
    under the vault of heaven, in the midst of the <mark class="term correct">Sabzih-Maydán</mark>, before the gaze of the multitude, there shall I celebrate my nuptials and witness the
    consummation of my hopes.” Three years later, when that lady learned of the circumstances attending the martyrdom of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> in the <mark class="term correct">Sabzih-Maydán</mark>, she
    recalled his prophetic words and understood their meaning.<a href="#_ftn175" name="_ftnref175" title="">[‡‡‡‡]</a> <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> remained in <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark> <mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>
    until the time when he was joined by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> after the latter’s return from his visit to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in the castle of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>. From <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark> <mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> they
    set out for <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, a journey rendered memorable by deeds so heroic that none of their countrymen could hope to rival them.
</p>As to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark>, as soon as he arrived at <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>, he enquired of a trusted friend, a native of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, about the <a name="Page_184"></a>latest
    developments connected with the progress of the Cause in that province. He was particularly anxious to be enlightened concerning the activities of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad-i-Az<u>gh</u>andí</mark>, and expressed his surprise at the seeming inactivity of one who, at a time when the mystery of the Faith was still undivulged, had
    displayed such conspicuous zeal in preparing the people for the acceptance of the expected Manifestation.
<p></p>“<mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>,” he was told, “secluded himself for a considerable period of time in his own home, and there concentrated his energies upon the preparation
    of a learned and voluminous compilation of <mark class="term correct">Islámic</mark> traditions and prophecies relating to the time and the character of the promised Dispensation. He
    collected more than twelve thousand traditions of the most explicit character, the authenticity of which was universally recognised; and resolved to take
    whatever steps were required for the copying and the dissemination of that book. By encouraging his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> to quote publicly from its contents,
    in all congregations and gatherings, he hoped he would be able to remove such hindrances as might impede the progress of the Cause he had at heart.
<p></p>“When he arrived at <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>, he was warmly welcomed by his maternal uncle, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Az<u>gh</u>andí</mark>, the foremost <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> of that city, who, a few
    days before the arrival of his nephew, had sent him a written request to hasten to <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark> and deliver him from the machinations of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Karím</mark><u>Kh</u><mark class="term unknown">án</mark>, whom he regarded as a dangerous though unavowed enemy of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. The <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> called upon <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> to combat by every means in his power <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>’s pernicious influence; and wished him to establish permanently his residence in that city, that he might, through incessant exhortations and
    appeals, succeed in enlightening the minds of the people as to the true aims and intentions cherished by that malignant enemy.
<p></p>“<mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, concealing from his uncle his original intention to leave for <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, decided to prolong his stay in <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>. He showed him the book
which he had compiled, and shared its contents with the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> who thronged from every quarter of the city to meet him. All were greatly impressed    <a name="Page_185"></a>by the industry, the erudition, and the zeal which the compiler of that celebrated work had demonstrated.
<p></p>“Among those who came to visit <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> was a certain <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, a man who was wicked, ambitious, and haughty, who had recently returned from <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark>,
    where he had completed his studies and had been elevated to the rank of <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark>. In the course of his conversation with <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, he expressed a desire
    to peruse that book, and to be allowed to retain it for a few days, that he might acquire a fuller understanding of its contents. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and his
    nephew both acceded to his wish. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, who was to have returned the book, failed to redeem his promise. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, who had already suspected the
    insincerity of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>’s intentions, urged his uncle to remind the borrower of the pledge he had given. <mark class="term unknown">‘Tell</mark> your master,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> was the insolent reply to
    the messenger sent to claim the book, <mark class="term unknown">‘that</mark> after having satisfied myself as to the mischievous character of that compilation, I decided to destroy it.
    Last night I threw it into the pond, thereby obliterating its pages.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“Moved by deep and determined indignation at such deceitfulness and impertinence, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> resolved to wreak his vengeance upon him. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>
    succeeded, however, by his wise counsels, in pacifying the anger of his infuriated uncle and in dissuading him from carrying out the measures which he
    proposed to take. <mark class="term unknown">‘This</mark> punishment,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he urged, <mark class="term unknown">‘which</mark> you contemplate will excite the agitation of the people, and will stir up mischief and sedition. It
    will gravely interfere with the efforts which you wish me to exert in order to extinguish the influence of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Karím</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. He will
    undoubtedly seize the occasion to denounce you as a <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>, and will hold me responsible for having been the cause of your conversion. By this means he will
    both undermine your authority and earn the esteem and gratitude of the people. Leave him in the hands of God.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
</p><p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark> was greatly pleased to learn from the account of this incident that <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> was actually residing in <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>, and that no obstacles stood in
the way of his meeting with him. He went immediately to the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> in which <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was leading the congregational prayer and in which    <a name="Page_186"></a><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> delivered the sermon. Taking his seat in the first row among the worshippers, he joined them in prayer, after which he
    went straight to <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and publicly embraced him. Uninvited, he immediately afterwards ascended the pulpit and prepared to address the faithful
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, though at first startled, preferred to raise no objection, being curious to discover the motive, and ascertain the degree of the learning,
    of this sudden intruder. He motioned to his nephew to refrain from opposing him.
</p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark> prefaced his discourse with one of the <mark class="term unknown">best-known</mark> and most exquisitely written homilies of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, after which he addressed the congregation
    in these terms: “Render thanks to God, O people of learning, for, behold, the Gate of Divine Knowledge, which you deem to have been closed, is now wide
    open. The River of everlasting life has streamed forth from the city of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, and is conferring untold blessings upon the people of this land.
    Whoever has partaken of one drop from this Ocean of heavenly grace, no matter how humble and unlettered, has discovered in himself the power to unravel the
    profoundest mysteries, and has felt capable of expounding the most abstruse themes of ancient wisdom. And whoever,though he be the most learned expounder
    of the Faith of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, has chosen to rely upon his own competence and power and has disdained the Message of God, has condemned himself to irretrievable
    degradation and loss.”
<p></p><p>A wave of indignation and dismay swept over the entire congregation as these words of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark> pealed out this momentous announcement. The <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> rang
    with cries of “Blasphemy!” which an infuriated congregation shouted in horror against the speaker. “Descend from the pulpit,” rose the voice of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> amid the clamour and tumult of the people, as he motioned to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark> to hold his peace and to retire. No sooner had he regained the floor of the
    <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> than the whole company of the assembled worshippers rushed upon him and overwhelmed him with blows. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> immediately intervened, vigorously
    dispersed the crowd, and, seizing the hand of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark>, forcibly drew him to his side. “Withhold your hands,” he appealed to the multitude; “leave him
    in my custody. I will take him <a name="Page_187"></a>to my home, and will closely investigate the matter. A sudden fit of madness may have caused him to
    utter these words. I will myself examine him. If I find that his utterances are premeditated and that he himself firmly believes in the things which he has
    declared, I will, with my own hands, inflict upon him the punishment imposed by the law of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>.”
</p><p>By this solemn assurance, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark> was delivered from the savage attacks of his assailants. Divested of his <mark class="term correct">‘abá</mark>    <a href="#_ftn176" name="_ftnref176" title="">[§§§§]</a> and turban, deprived of his sandals and staff, bruised and shaken by the injuries he had received,
    he was entrusted to the care of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>’s attendants, who, as they forced their passage among the crowd, succeeded eventually in conducting him to
    the home of their master.
</p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Yúsúf-i-Ardibílí</mark><mark class="term correction">Yúsuf-i-Ardibílí</mark>, likewise, was subjected in those days to a persecution fiercer and more determined than the savage onslaught which the people of
    <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark> had directed against <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark>. But for the intervention of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and the assistance of his uncle, he would have fallen a victim to the wrath
    of a ferocious enemy.
<p></p>When <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Yúsúf-i-Ardibílí</mark><mark class="term correction">Yúsuf-i-Ardibílí</mark> arrived at <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark>, they again had to submit to similar indignities and to suffer similar afflictions at the
    hands of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Karím</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> and his associates.<a href="#_ftn177" name="_ftnref177" title="">[*****]</a><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád</mark>’s persistent exertions
    freed them eventually from the grasp of their persecutors, and enabled them to proceed to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>.
<p></p>Though hunted and harassed by their foes, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s immediate disciples, together with their companions in different parts of Persia, were undeterred by
    such criminal acts <a name="Page_188"></a>from the accomplishment of their task. Unswerving in their purpose and immovable in their convictions, they
    continued to battle with the dark forces that assailed them every step of their path. By their unstinted devotion and unexampled fortitude, they were able
    to demonstrate to many of their countrymen the ennobling influence of the Faith they had arisen to champion.
<p></p>While <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark><a href="#_ftn178" name="_ftnref178" title="">[†††††]</a> was still in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád-i-Karbilá’í</mark><a href="#_ftn179" name="_ftnref179" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡]</a> arrived and was introduced by <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> into the presence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. In a Tablet
    which He addressed to <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> extolled the firmness of their faith and stressed the unalterable character of their devotion.
    The latter had met and known the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> before the declaration of His Mission, and had been a fervent admirer of those extraordinary traits of character which
    had distinguished Him ever since His childhood. At a later time, he met <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark> and became the recipient of His special favour. When,
    a few years afterwards, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was exiled to Adrianople, he, already much advanced in years, returned to Persia, tarried awhile in the province of
    <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, and thence proceeded to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. His kindly disposition, extreme forbearance, and unaffected simplicity earned him the appellation of the
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Núr</mark>.<a href="#_ftn180" name="_ftnref180" title="">[§§§§§]</a><p></p><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád</mark>, one day, while crossing a street in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, suddenly saw the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> as he was passing on horseback. Undisturbed by the presence of
    his sovereign, he calmly approached and greeted him. His venerable figure and dignity of bearing pleased the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> immensely. He acknowledged his
    salute and invited him to come and see him. Such was the reception accorded him that the courtiers of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> were moved with envy. “Does not your
    Imperial Majesty realise,” they protested, “that this <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><a name="Page_189"></a><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád</mark> is none other than the man who, even prior to the
    declaration of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>, had proclaimed himself a <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>, and had pledged his undying loyalty to his person?” The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, perceiving the malice
    which actuated their accusation, was sorely displeased, and rebuked them for their temerity and <mark class="term unknown">low-mindedness</mark>. “How strange!” he is reported to have
    exclaimed; “whoever is distinguished by the uprightness of his conduct and the courtesy of his manners, my people forthwith denounce him as a <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> and
    regard him as an object worthy of my condemnation!”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Javád</mark> spent the last days of his life in <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark> and remained until his last hour a staunch supporter of the Faith. He never wavered in his
    convictions nor relaxed in his unsparing endeavours for the diffusion of the Cause.
</p><u>Sh</u>
    ay<u>kh</u><mark class="term correct">Sulṭán-i-Karbilá’í</mark>, whose ancestors ranked among the leading <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, and who himself had been a firm supporter and intimate
    companion of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, was also among those who, in those days, had met the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. It was he who, at a later time, proceeded to
    <mark class="term correct">Sulaymáníyyih</mark> in search of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, and whose daughter was subsequently given in marriage to <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark>. When he arrived at <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, he was
    accompanied by <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Zunúzí</mark>, to whom we have referred in the early pages of this narrative. To him the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> assigned the task of
    transcribing, in collaboration with <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark>, the Tablets which He had lately revealed. <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Sulṭán</mark>, who had been too ill, at
    the time of his arrival, to meet the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, received one night, while still on his <mark class="term unknown">sick-bed</mark>, a message from his <a name="Page_190"></a>Beloved, informing him
    that at about two hours after sunset He would Himself visit him. That night the Ethiopian servant, who was acting as <mark class="term unknown">lantern-bearer</mark> to his Master, was
    instructed to walk in advance at a distance which would keep away the attention of the people from Him, and to extinguish the lantern as soon as he reached
    his destination.
<p></p>I have heard <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Sulṭán</mark> himself describe that nocturnal visit: “The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, who had bidden me extinguish the lamp in my room ere He arrived,
    came straight to my bedside. In the midst of the darkness which enveloped us, I was holding fast to the hem of His garment and was imploring Him: <mark class="term unknown">‘Fulfil</mark>
my desire, O Beloved of my heart, and allow me to sacrifice myself for Thee; for no one else except Thee is able to confer upon me this favour.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘O</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark>!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> replied, <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> too yearn to immolate Myself upon the altar of sacrifice. It behoves us both to cling to the garment of the
    <mark class="term unknown">Best-Beloved</mark> and to seek from Him the joy and glory of martyrdom in His path. Rest assured I will, in your behalf, supplicate the Almighty to enable you to
    attain His presence. Remember Me on that Day, a Day such as the world has never seen before.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> As the hour of parting approached, he placed in my hand a
    gift which He asked me to expend for myself. I tried to refuse; but He begged me to accept it. Finally I acceded to His wish; whereupon He arose and
    departed.
<p></p>“The allusion of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> that night to His ‘<mark class="term unknown">Best-Beloved</mark>’ excited my wonder and curiosity. In the years that followed I oftentimes believed that the one to
    whom the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had referred was none other than <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>. I even imagined <mark class="term misspelled">Siyyid-i-’Uluvv</mark><mark class="term correction">Siyyid-i-‘Uluvv</mark> to be that person. I was sorely perplexed, and knew not how to
    unravel this mystery. When I reached <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> and attained the presence of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, I became firmly convinced that He alone could claim such affection
    from the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, that He, and only He, could be worthy of such adoration.”
<p></p><p>The second <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark> after the declaration of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s Mission, which fell on the <mark class="term unknown">twenty-first</mark> day of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’l-Avval</mark> <mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’l-Avval</mark>, in the year 1262 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn181" name="_ftnref181" title="">[******]</a> found the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> still in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> enjoying, under circumstances of comparative tranquillity
    and ease, the blessings of undisturbed association <a name="Page_191"></a>with His family and kindred. Quietly and unceremoniously, He celebrated the
    festival of <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark> in His own home, and, in accordance with His invariable custom, bountifully conferred upon both His mother and His wife the marks of
    His affection and favour. By the wisdom of His counsels and the tenderness of His love, He cheered their hearts and dispelled their apprehensions. He
    bequeathed to them all His possessions and transferred to their names the title to His property. In a document which He Himself wrote and signed, He
    directed that His house and its furniture, as well as the rest of His estate, should be regarded as the exclusive property of His mother and His wife; and
    that upon the death of the former, her share of the property should revert to His wife.
</p>The mother of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> failed at first to realise the significance of the Mission proclaimed by her Son. She remained for a time unaware of the magnitude of
    the forces latent in His Revelation. As she approached the end of her life, however, she was able to perceive the inestimable quality of that Treasure
    which she had conceived and given to the world. It was <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> who eventually enabled her to discover the value of that hidden Treasure which had lain
    for so many years concealed from her eyes. She was living in <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, where she hoped to spend the remaining days of her life, when <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> instructed
    two of His devoted followers, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád-i-Karbilá’í</mark> and the wife of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Majíd-i-<u>Sh</u>írází</mark>, both of whom were already intimately
    acquainted with her, to instruct her in the principles of the Faith. She acknowledged the truth of the Cause and remained, until the closing years of the
    thirteenth century A.H.,<a href="#_ftn182" name="_ftnref182" title="">[††††††]</a> when she departed this life, fully aware of the bountiful gifts which
    the Almighty had chosen to confer upon her.
<p></p>The wife of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, unlike His mother, perceived at the earliest dawn of His Revelation the glory and uniqueness of His Mission and felt from the very
    beginning the intensity of its force. No one except <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>, among the women of her generation, surpassed her in the spontaneous character of her devotion
    nor excelled the fervor of her faith. To her the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> confided the secret of His future sufferings, and unfolded <a name="Page_192"></a>to her eyes the
    significance of the events that were to transpire in His Day. He bade her not to divulge this secret to His mother and counselled her to be patient and
    resigned to the will of God. He entrusted her with a special prayer, revealed and written by Himself, the reading of which, He assured her, would remove
    her difficulties and lighten the burden of her woes. “In the hour of your perplexity,” He directed her, “recite this prayer ere you go to sleep. I Myself
    will appear to you and will banish your anxiety.” Faithful to His advice, every time she turned to Him in prayer, the light of His unfailing guidance
    illumined her path and resolved her problems.<a href="#_ftn183" name="_ftnref183" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><p></p>After the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had settled the affairs of His household and provided for the future maintenance of both His mother and His wife, He transferred His
    residence from His own home to that of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>. There He awaited the approaching hour of His sufferings. He knew that the afflictions which
    were in store for Him could no longer be delayed, that He was soon to be caught in a whirlwind of adversity which would carry Him swiftly to the field of
martyrdom, the crowning object of His life. He bade those of His disciples who had settled in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, among whom were <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark> and    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Zunúzí</mark>, to proceed to <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark> and there await His further instructions. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Yazdí</mark>, <a name="Page_193"></a>one of
    the Letters of the Living, who had recently arrived at <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, was likewise instructed to proceed to <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark> and to join the company of his
    <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> in that city.
<p></p>Meanwhile <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the governor of <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark>, was bending every effort to involve the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in fresh embarrassments and to degrade Him still further in
    the eyes of the public. The smouldering fire of his hostility was fanned to flame by the knowledge that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was allowed to pursue unmolested the course
    of His activities, that He was still able to associate with certain of His companions, and that He continued to enjoy the benefits of unrestrained
    fellowship with His family and kindred.<a href="#_ftn184" name="_ftnref184" title="">[§§§§§§]</a> By the aid of his secret agents, he succeeded in
    obtaining accurate information regarding <a name="Page_194"></a>the character and influence of the Movement which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had initiated. He had secretly
    watched His movements, ascertained the degree of enthusiasm which He had aroused, and scrutinised the motives, the conduct, and the number of those who had
    embraced His Cause.
<p></p>One night there came to <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> the chief of his emissaries with the report that the number of those who were crowding to see the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had
    assumed such proportions as to necessitate immediate action on the part of those whose function it was to guard the security of the city. “The eager crowd
    that gathers every night to visit the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>,” he remarked, “surpasses in number the multitude of people that throngs every day before the gates of the seat
of your government. Among them are to be seen men celebrated alike for their exalted rank and extensive learning.    <a href="#_ftn185" name="_ftnref185" title="">[*******]</a> Such are the tact and lavish generosity which his maternal uncle displays in his attitude
    towards the officials of your government that no one among your subordinates is inclined to acquaint you with the reality of the situation. If you would
    permit me, I will, with the aid of a number of your attendants, surprise the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> at the hour of midnight and will deliver, handcuffed, into your hands
    certain of his associates who will enlighten you concerning his activities, and who will confirm the truth of my statements.” <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> refused to
    comply with his wish. “I can tell better than <a name="Page_195"></a>you,” was his answer, “what the interests of the State require. Watch me from a
    distance; I shall know how to deal with him.”
<p></p><p>That very moment, the governor summoned <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the chief constable of the city. “Proceed immediately,” he commanded him, “to the house
    of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>. Quietly and unobserved, scale the wall and ascend to the roof, and from there suddenly enter his home. Arrest the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>
    immediately, and conduct him to this place together with any of the visitors who may be present with him at that time. Confiscate whatever books and
    documents you are able to find in that house. As to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, it is my intention to impose upon him, the following day, the penalty for
    having failed to redeem his promise. I swear by the imperial diadem of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> that this very night I shall have the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> executed
    together with his wretched companions. Their ignominious death will quench the flame they have kindled, and will awaken every <mark class="term unknown">would-be</mark> follower of that
    creed to the danger that awaits every disturber of the peace of this realm. By this act I shall have extirpated a heresy the continuance of which
    constitutes the gravest menace to the interests of the State.”
</p><p><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> retired to execute his task. He, together with his assistants, broke into the house of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>    <a href="#_ftn186" name="_ftnref186" title="">[†††††††]</a> and found the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in the company of His maternal uncle and a certain <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim-i-Zanjání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim-i-Zanjání</mark>,
    who was later martyred in <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, and whose brother, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Murtadá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Murtaḍá</mark>, was one of the Seven Martyrs of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. He immediately arrested them, collected
    whatever documents he could find, ordered <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> to remain in his house, and conducted the rest to the seat of government. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>,
    undaunted and <mark class="term unknown">self-possessed</mark>, was heard to repeat this verse of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>: “That with which they are threatened is for the morning. Is not the morning
    near?” No sooner had the chief constable reached the marketplace than he discovered, to his amazement, that the people of the city were fleeing from every
    side in consternation, as if overtaken by an appalling calamity. He was struck <a name="Page_196"></a>with horror when he witnessed the long train of
    coffins being hurriedly transported through the streets, each followed by a procession of men and women loudly uttering shrieks of agony and pain. This
    sudden tumult, the lamentations, the affrighted countenances, the imprecations of the multitude distressed and bewildered him. He enquired as to the
    reason. “This very night,” he was told, “a plague<a href="#_ftn187" name="_ftnref187" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> of exceptional virulence has broken out. We
    are smitten by its devastating power. Already since the hour of midnight it has extinguished the lives of over a hundred people. Alarm and despair reign in
every house. The people are abandoning their homes, and in their plight are invoking the aid of the Almighty.”    <a href="#_ftn188" name="_ftnref188" title="">[§§§§§§§]</a>
</p><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, terrified by this dreadful intelligence, ran to the home of <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. An old man who guarded his house and was acting
    as <mark class="term unknown">door-keeper</mark> informed him that the house of his master was deserted, that the ravages of the pestilence had devastated his home and afflicted the members
    of his household. “Two of his Ethiopian maids,” he was told, “and a <mark class="term unknown">man-servant</mark> have already fallen victims to this scourge, and members of his own family
are now dangerously ill. In his despair, my master has abandoned his home and, leaving the dead unburied, has fled with the rest of his family to the Ba    <mark class="term unknown"><u>gh</u>-i-Ta<u>kh</u>t</mark>.”<a href="#_ftn189" name="_ftnref189" title="">[********]</a><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> decided to conduct the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to his own home and keep Him in his custody pending instructions from the governor. As he was
    approaching his house, he was struck by the sound of weeping and wailing of the members of his household. His son had been attacked by the plague and was
    hovering on the brink of death. In his despair, he threw himself at the feet of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and tearfully implored Him to save the life of his son. He begged
    Him to forgive his past transgressions and misdeeds. “I adjure you,” he entreated the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> as he clung to the hem of His garment, “by Him who has elevated
    you to this exalted <a name="Page_197"></a>position, to intercede in my behalf and to offer a prayer for the recovery of my son. Suffer not that he, in the
    prime of youth, be taken away from me. Punish him not for the guilt which his father has committed. I repent of what I have done, and at this moment resign
    my post. I solemnly pledge my word that never again will I accept such a position even though I perish of hunger.”
<p></p><p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, who was in the act of performing His ablutions and was preparing to offer the prayer of dawn, directed him to take some of the water with which He
    was washing His face to his son and request him to drink it. This He said would save his life.
</p>No sooner had <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> witnessed the signs of the recovery of his son than he wrote a letter to the governor in which he acquainted him
    with the whole situation and begged him to cease his attacks on the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. “Have pity on yourself,” he wrote him, “as well as on those whom Providence has
    committed to your care. Should the fury of this plague continue its fatal course, no one in this city, I fear, will by the end of this day have survived
the horror of its attack.” <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> replied that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> should be immediately released and given freedom to go wherever He might please.    <a href="#_ftn190" name="_ftnref190" title="">[††††††††]</a><p></p>As soon as an account of these happenings reached <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and was brought to the attention of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, an imperial edict dismissing <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><u>Kh</u><mark class="term unknown">án</mark> from office was issued and sent to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. From the day of his dismissal, that shameless tyrant fell a victim to countless misfortunes, and was
    in the end unable to earn even his daily bread. No one seemed willing or able to save him from his evil plight. When, at a later time, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had been
    banished to <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> sent Him a letter in which he expressed repentance and promised to atone for his past misdeeds on condition
    that he should regain his former position. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> refused to answer him. Sunk in misery and shame, he languished until his death.
<p></p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, who was staying at the home of <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, sent <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> to request <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> to <a name="Page_198"></a>come and
    see Him. He informed His uncle of His intended departure from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, entrusted both His mother and His wife to his care, and charged him to convey
    to each the expression of His affection and the assurance of God’s unfailing assistance. “Wherever they may be,” He told His uncle, as He bade him
    farewell, “God’s <mark class="term unknown">all-encompassing</mark> love and protection will surround them. I will again meet you amid the mountains of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>, from whence I
    will send you forth to obtain the crown of martyrdom. I Myself will follow you, together with one of My loyal disciples, and will join you in the realm of
    eternity.” <a name="Page_199"></a>CHAPTER X: THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>’S SOJOURN IN <mark class="term correct">IṢFÁHÁN</mark>THE summer of the year 1262 A.H.<a href="#_ftn191" name="_ftnref191" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> was drawing to a close when the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> bade His last farewell to
    His native city of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, and proceeded to <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim-i-Zanjání</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim-i-Zanjání</mark> accompanied Him on that journey. As He approached the outskirts of the
city, He wrote a letter to the governor of the province, <mark class="term correct">Manú<u>ch</u>ihr</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamídu’d-Dawlih</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamidu’d-Dawlih</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn192" name="_ftnref192" title="">[§§§§§§§§]</a> in which He requested him to signify his wish as to the place where He could dwell. The
    letter, which He entrusted to <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, was expressive of such courtesy and revealed such exquisite penmanship that the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> was moved to instruct
    the <mark class="term correct">Sulṭánu’l-‘Ulamá</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn193" name="_ftnref193" title="">[*********]</a> the foremost ecclesiastical authority of
    that province, to receive the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in his own home and to accord Him a kindly and generous <a name="Page_200"></a>reception. In addition to his message, the
    governor sent the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> the letter he had received from the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. The <mark class="term correct">Sulṭánu’l-‘Ulamá</mark> accordingly bade his own brother, whose savage cruelty in later
    years earned him the appellation of <a name="Page_201"></a><mark class="term misspelled">Raq<u>sh</u>a’</mark><mark class="term correction">Raq<u>sh</u>á</mark><a href="#_ftn194" name="_ftnref194" title="">[†††††††††]</a> from <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, to
    proceed with a number of his favourite companions to meet and escort the expected Visitor to the gate of the city. As the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> approached, the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>
    went out to welcome Him in person, and conducted Him ceremoniously to his house.
<p></p>Such were the honours accorded to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in those days that when, on a certain Friday, He was returning from the public bath to the house, a multitude of
    people were seen eagerly clamouring for the water which He had used for His ablutions. His fervent admirers firmly believed in its unfailng virtue and
    power to heal their sicknesses and ailments. The <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> himself had, from the very first night, become so enamoured with Him who was the object of
    such devotion, that, assuming the functions of an attendant, he undertook to minister to the needs and wants of his beloved Guest. Seizing the ewer from
    the hand of the chief steward and utterly ignoring the customary dignity of his rank, he proceeded to pour out the water over the hands of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>.
<p></p>One night, after supper, the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>, whose curiosity had been excited by the extraordinary traits of character which his youthful Guest had revealed,
    ventured to request Him to reveal a commentary on the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Va’l-‘Asr</mark><mark class="term correction">Va’l-‘Aṣr</mark>.<a href="#_ftn195" name="_ftnref195" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> His request was
    readily granted. Calling for pen and paper, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, with astonishing rapidity and without the least premeditation, began to reveal, in the presence of His
    host, a most illuminating interpretation of the aforementioned <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark>. It was nearing midnight when the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> found Himself engaged in the exposition of the
    manifold implications involved in the first letter of that <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark>. That letter, the letter ‘<mark class="term unknown">váv</mark>’ upon which <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aḥmad-i-Ahsá’í</mark><mark class="term correction">Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í</mark> had already
    laid such emphasis in his writings, symbolised for the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> the advent of a new cycle of Divine Revelation, and has since been alluded to by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in
    the “<mark class="term misspelled">Kitab-i-Aqdas</mark><mark class="term correction">Kitáb-i-Aqdas</mark>” in such passages as “the mastery of the Great Reversal” and “the Sign of the Sovereign.” The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> soon after began to chant, in the
    presence of His host and his companions, the homily with which He had prefaced His commentary on the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark>. Those words of power confounded His hearers
    with wonder. <a name="Page_202"></a>They seemed as if bewitched by the magic of His voice. Instinctively they started to their feet and, together with the
    <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>, reverently kissed the hem of His garment. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-Taqíy-i-Haratí</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-Taqíy-i-Harátí</mark>, an eminent <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark>, broke out into a sudden expression of exultation
    and praise. “Peerless and unique,” he exclaimed, “as are the words which have streamed from this pen, to be able to reveal, within so short a time and in
    so legible a writing, so great a number of verses as to equal a fourth, nay a third, of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, is in itself an achievement such as no mortal, without
    the intervention of God, could hope to perform. Neither the cleaving of the moon nor the quickening of the pebbles of the sea can compare with so mighty an
    act.”
<p></p><p>As the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s fame was being gradually diffused over the entire city of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, an unceasing stream of visitors flowed from every quarter to the house of
    the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>: a few to satisfy their curiosity, others to obtain a deeper understanding of the fundamental verities of His Faith, and still others to
    seek the remedy for their ills and sufferings. The <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> himself came one day to visit the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and, while seated in the midst of an assemblage of the
most brilliant and accomplished divines of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, requested Him to expound the nature and demonstrate the validity of the <mark class="term misspelled">Nubuvvat-i-<u>Kh</u>assih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Nubuvvat-i-<u>Kh</u>áṣṣih</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn196" name="_ftnref196" title="">[§§§§§§§§§]</a> He had previously, in that same gathering, called upon those who were present to adduce such
    proofs and evidences in support of this fundamental article of their Faith as would constitute an unanswerable testimony for those who were inclined to
    repudiate its truth. No one, however, seemed capable of responding to his invitation. “Which do you prefer,” asked the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, “a verbal or a written answer
    to your question?” “A written reply,” he answered, “not only would please those who are present at this meeting, but would edify and instruct both the
    present and future generations.”
</p><p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> instantly took up His pen and began to write. In less than two hours, He had filled about fifty pages with a most refreshing and circumstantial
enquiry into the origin, the character, and the pervasive influence of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. The originality of His dissertation, the vigour and vividness of    <a name="Page_203"></a>its style, the accuracy of its minutest details, invested His treatment of that noble theme with an excellence which no one among
    those who were present on that occasion could have failed to perceive. With masterly insight, He linked the central idea in the concluding passages of this
exposition with the advent of the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> and the expected “Return” of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn197" name="_ftnref197" title="">[**********]</a> He argued with such force <a name="Page_204"></a>and courage that those who heard Him recite
    its verses were astounded by the magnitude of His revelation. No one dared to insinuate the slightest objection—much less, openly to challenge His
    statements. The <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> could not help giving vent to his enthusiasm and joy. “Hear me!” he exclaimed. “Members of this revered assembly, I take you as my
    witnesses. Never until this day have I in my heart been firmly convinced of the truth of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. I can henceforth, thanks to this exposition penned by this
    Youth, declare myself a firm believer in the Faith proclaimed by the Apostle of God. I solemnly testify to my belief in the reality of the superhuman power
    with which this Youth is endowed, a power which no amount of learning can ever impart.” With these words he brought the meeting to an end.
</p>The growing popularity of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> aroused the resentment of the ecclesiastical authorities of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, who viewed with concern and envy the ascendancy
    which an unlearned Youth was slowly acquiring over the thoughts and consciences of their followers. They firmly believed that unless they rose to stem the
    tide of popular enthusiasm, the very foundations of their existence would be undermined. A few of the more sagacious among them thought it wise to abstain
    from acts of direct hostility to either the person or the teachings of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, as such action, they felt, would serve only to enhance His prestige and
    consolidate His position. The <mark class="term unknown">mischief-makers</mark>, however, were busily engaged in disseminating the wildest reports concerning the character and claims of the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. These reports soon reached <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and were brought to the attention of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>. This haughty and
    overbearing minister viewed with apprehension the possibility that his sovereign might one day feel inclined to befriend the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, an inclination which he
    felt sure would precipitate his own downfall. The <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> was, moreover, apprehensive lest the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark>, who enjoyed the confidence of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, should
    succeed in arranging an interview between the sovereign and the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. He was well aware that should such an interview take place, the impressionable and
    <mark class="term unknown">tender-hearted</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> would be completely won over by the attractiveness and novelty of that creed. Spurred on by <a name="Page_205"></a>such
    reflections, he addressed a strongly worded communication to the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>, in which he upbraided him for his grave neglect of the obligation imposed
    upon him to safeguard the interests of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. “We have expected you,” <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark> wrote him, “to resist with all your power every cause which
    conflicts with the best interests of the government and people of this land. You seem instead to have befriended, nay to have glorified, the author of this
    obscure and contemptible movement.” He likewise wrote a number of encouraging letters to the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, whom he had previously ignored but upon
    whom he now lavished his special favours. The <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>, while refusing to alter his respectful attitude towards his Guest, was induced by the tone of
    the message he had received from the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, to instruct his associates to devise such means as would tend to lessen the <mark class="term unknown">ever-increasing</mark> number of
    visitors who thronged each day to the presence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Mihdí</mark>, surnamed the <mark class="term misspelled">Safihu’l-’Ulama’</mark><mark class="term correction">Safíhu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>, son of the late <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Kalbásí</mark>, in his desire to
    gratify the wish and to earn the esteem of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, began to calumniate the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> from the pulpit in the most unseemly language.
<p></p>As soon as the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> was informed of these developments, he sent a message to the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> in which he reminded him of the visit he as governor had
    paid to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and extended to him as well as to his Guest an invitation to his home. The <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> invited <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark>, son of the late <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct">Báqir-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-Ja’far-i-Abadiyí</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-Ja‘far-i-Ábadiyí</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Mihdí</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Núrí</mark>, and a few others to be present at that meeting.
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark> refused the invitation and endeavoured to dissuade those who had been invited, from participating in that gathering. “I have sought
    to excuse myself,” he informed them, “and I would most certainly urge you to do the same. I regard it as most unwise of you to meet the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> face
    to face. He will, no doubt, reassert his claim and will, in support of his argument, adduce whatever proof you may desire him to give, and, without the
    least hesitation, will reveal as a testimony to the truth he bears, verses of such a number as would equal half the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>. In the end he will challenge
    you in these words: <mark class="term unknown">‘Produce</mark> likewise, <a name="Page_206"></a>if ye are men of truth.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> We can in no wise successfully resist him. If we disdain to answer
    him, our impotence will have been exposed. If we, on the other hand, submit to his claim, we shall not only be forfeiting our own reputation, our own
    prerogatives and rights, but will have committed <a name="Page_207"></a>ourselves to acknowledge any further claims that he may feel inclined to make in
    the future.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-Ja’far</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-Ja‘far</mark> heeded this counsel and refused to accept the invitation of the governor. <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Núrí</mark>, and a few others who
    disdained such advice, presented themselves at the appointed hour at the home of the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark>. At the invitation of the host, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, a noted
Platonist, requested the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to elucidate certain abstruse philosophical doctrines connected with the <mark class="term unknown">Ar<u>sh</u>íyyih</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Sadrá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣadrá</mark>,<a href="#_ftn198" name="_ftnref198" title="">[††††††††††]</a> the meaning of which only a few had been able to unravel.    <a href="#_ftn199" name="_ftnref199" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> In simple and unconventional language, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> replied to each of his questions. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, though unable to apprehend the meaning of the answers which he had received, realised how inferior was the learning of the <mark class="term unknown">so-called</mark> exponents of
    the Platonic and the Aristotelian schools of thought of his day to the knowledge displayed by that Youth. <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark> ventured in his turn to question
    the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> regarding certain aspects of the <mark class="term correct">Islámic</mark> law. Dissatisfied with the explanation he received, he began to contend idly with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. He was soon
    silenced by the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark>, who, cutting short his conversation, turned to an attendant and, bidding him light the lantern, gave the order that <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark> be immediately conducted to his home. The <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> subsequently <a name="Page_208"></a>confided his apprehensions to the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>. “I fear the
    machinations of the enemies of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>,” he told him. “The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> has summoned Him to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. I am commanded to arrange for His departure. I
    deem it more advisable for Him to stay in my home until such time as He can leave this city.” The <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> acceded to his request and returned alone to
    his house.
</p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had tarried forty days at the residence of the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>. While He was still there, a certain <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-Taqíy-i-Haratí</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-Taqíy-i-Harátí</mark>, who was privileged
    to meet the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> every day, undertook, with His consent, to translate one of His works, entitled <mark class="term misspelled">Risáliy-i-Furú-i-‘Adlíyyih</mark><mark class="term correction">Risáliy-i-Furú‘-i-‘Adlíyyih</mark>, from the original Arabic into
    Persian. The service he thereby rendered to the Persian believers was marred, however, by his subsequent behaviour. Fear suddenly seized him, and he was
    induced eventually to sever his connection with his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-believers</mark>.
<p></p>Ere the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had transferred His residence to the house of the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ibráhím</mark>, father of the <mark class="term unknown">Sulṭánu’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>uhudá’</mark> and elder brother of
    <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alíy-i-Nahrí</mark>, to whom we have already referred, invited the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to his home one night. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ibráhím</mark> was a friend of the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>, was
    intimately associated with him, and controlled the management of all his affairs. The banquet which was spread for the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> that night was one of
    unsurpassed magnificence. It was commonly observed that neither the officials nor the notables of the city had offered a feast of such magnitude and
    splendour. The <mark class="term unknown">Sulṭánu’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>uhudá’</mark> and his brother, the <mark class="term correct">Maḥbúbu’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>uhadá’</mark>, who were lads of nine and eleven, respectively,
    served at that banquet and received special attention from the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. That night, during dinner, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ibráhím</mark> turned to his Guest and said: “My brother,
    <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>, has no child. I beg You to intercede in his behalf and to grant his heart’s desire.” The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> took a portion of the food with which He
    had been served, placed it with His own hands on a platter, and handed it to His host, asking him to take it to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark> and his wife. “Let them
both partake of this,” He said; “their wish will be fulfilled.” By virtue of that portion which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had chosen to bestow upon her, the wife of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><a name="Page_209"></a><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark> conceived and in due time gave birth to a girl, who eventually was joined in wedlock with the Most Great Branch,    <a href="#_ftn200" name="_ftnref200" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§]</a> a union that came to be regarded as the consummation of the hopes entertained by her
    parents.
<p></p>The high honours accorded to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> served further to inflame the hostility of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>. With feelings of dismay, they beheld on every side
    evidences of His <mark class="term unknown">all-pervasive</mark> influence invading the stronghold of orthodoxy and subverting their foundations. They summoned a gathering, at which they
issued a written document, signed and sealed by all the ecclesiastical leaders of the city, condemning the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to death.    <a href="#_ftn201" name="_ftnref201" title="">[***********]</a> They all concurred in this condemnation with the exception of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark> and
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-Ja’far-i-Abadiyí</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-Ja‘far-i-Ábadiyí</mark>, both of whom refused to associate themselves with the contents of so glaringly abusive a document. The <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>, though
    declining to endorse the <mark class="term unknown">death-warrant</mark> of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, was induced, by reason of his extreme cowardice and ambition, to add to that document, in his own
    handwriting, the following testimony: “I testify that in the course of my association with this youth I have been unable to discover any act that would in
    any way betray his repudiation of the doctrines of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. On the contrary, I have known him as a pious and loyal observer of its precepts. The extravagance
    of his claims, however, and his disdainful contempt for the things of the world, incline me to believe that he is devoid of reason and judgment.”
<p></p><p>No sooner had the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> been informed of the condemnation pronounced by the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark> than he determined, by a plan which he himself conceived,
    to nullify the effects of that cruel verdict. He issued immediate instructions that towards the hour of sunset the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, escorted by five hundred horsemen
    of the governor’s own mounted <mark class="term unknown">body-guard</mark>, should leave the gate of the city and proceed in the direction of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. Imperative orders had been given that
    at the completion of each <mark class="term correct">farsang</mark><a href="#_ftn202" name="_ftnref202" title="">[†††††††††††]</a> one hundred of this mounted escort should return directly
    to <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>. <a name="Page_210"></a>To the chief of the last remaining contingent, a man in whom he placed implicit confidence, the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> confidentially
    intimated his desire that at every <mark class="term correct">maydán</mark><a href="#_ftn203" name="_ftnref203" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> twenty of the <a name="Page_211"></a>remaining
    hundred should likewise be ordered by him to return to the city. Of the twenty remaining horsemen, the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> directed that ten should be despatched to
    <mark class="term correct">Ardistán</mark> for the purpose of collecting the taxes levied by the government, and that the rest, all of whom should be of his tried and most reliable men,
    should, by an unfrequented route, bring the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> back in disguise to <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>.<a href="#_ftn204" name="_ftnref204" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> They were,
    moreover, instructed so to regulate their march that before dawn of the ensuing day the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> should have arrived at <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark> and should have been delivered
    into his custody. This plan was immediately taken in hand and duly executed. At an unsuspected hour the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> <mark class="term unknown">re-entered</mark> the city, was directly conducted to
the private residence of the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark>, known by the name of <mark class="term misspelled">Imárat-i-<u>Kh</u>ur<u>sh</u>íd</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Imárat-i-<u>Kh</u>ur<u>sh</u>íd</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn205" name="_ftnref205" title="">[************]</a> and was introduced, through a side entrance reserved for the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> himself, into his
private apartments. The governor waited in person on the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, served His meals, and provided whatever was required for His comfort and safety.    <a href="#_ftn206" name="_ftnref206" title="">[††††††††††††]</a> <a name="Page_212"></a>Meanwhile the wildest conjectures obtained currency in the city regarding the journey of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, the sufferings which He was made to endure on
    His way to the capital, the verdict which had been pronounced against Him, and the penalty which He had suffered. These rumours greatly distressed the
    believers who were residing in <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>. The <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark>, who was well aware of their grief and anxiety, interceded with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in their behalf and begged to
    be allowed to introduce them into His presence. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> addressed a few words in His own handwriting to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím-i-Qazvíní</mark>, who had taken up his
    quarters in the <mark class="term correct">madrisih</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ním-Ávard</mark>, and instructed the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> to send it to him by a trusted messenger. An hour later, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark> was ushered
    into the presence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. Of his arrival no one except the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> was informed. He received from his Master some of His writings, and was instructed
    to transcribe them in collaboration with <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Yazdí</mark> and <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Zunúzí</mark>. To these he soon returned, bearing the welcome news
    of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s <mark class="term unknown">well-being</mark> and safety. Of all the believers residing in <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, these three alone were allowed to see Him.
</p>One day, while seated with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in his private garden within the courtyard of his house, the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark>, taking his Guest into his confidence, addressed
    Him in these words: “The almighty Giver has endowed me with great riches.<a href="#_ftn207" name="_ftnref207" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> I know not how
    best to use them. Now that I have, by the aid of God, been led to recognise this Revelation, it is my ardent desire to consecrate all my possessions to the
    furtherance of its interests and the spread of its fame. It is my intention to proceed, by Your leave, to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, and to do my best to win to this Cause
    <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, whose confidence in me is firm and unshaken. I am certain that he will eagerly embrace it, and will arise to promote it far and wide.
    I will also endeavour to induce the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> to dismiss the profligate <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, the folly of whose administration has <mark class="term unknown">well-nigh</mark> brought this
    land to the verge of ruin. Next, I will strive to obtain for You the hand of one of the <a name="Page_213"></a>sisters of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, and will myself
    undertake the preparation of Your nuptials. Finally, I hope to be enabled to incline the hearts of the rulers and kings of the earth to this most wondrous
    Cause and to extirpate every lingering trace of that corrupt ecclesiastical hierarchy that has stained the fair name of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>.” “May God requite you for
    your noble intentions,” the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> replied. “So lofty a purpose is to Me even more precious than the act itself. Your days and Mine are numbered, however;
    they are too short to enable Me to witness, and allow you to achieve, the realisation of your hopes. Not by the means which you fondly imagine will an
    almighty Providence accomplish the triumph of His Faith. Through the poor and lowly of this land, by the blood which these shall have shed in His path,
    will the omnipotent Sovereign ensure the preservation and consolidate the foundation of His Cause. That same God will, in the world to come, place upon
    your head the crown of immortal glory, and will shower upon you His inestimable blessings. Of the span of your earthly life there remain only three months
    and nine days, after which you shall, with faith and certitude, hasten to your eternal abode.” The <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> greatly rejoiced at these words. Resigned to
    the will of God, he prepared himself for the departure which the words of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had so clearly foreshadowed. He wrote his testament, settled his private
    affairs, and bequeathed whatever he possessed to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. Immediately after his death, however, his nephew, the rapacious <mark class="term correct">Gurgín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, discovered
    and destroyed his will, seized his property, and contemptuously ignored his wishes.
<p></p>As the days of his earthly life were drawing to a close, the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> increasingly sought the presence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and, in his hours of intimate fellowship
    with Him, obtained a deeper realisation of the spirit which animated His Faith. “As the hour of my departure approaches,” he one day told the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, “I feel
    an undefinable joy pervading my soul. But I am apprehensive for You, I tremble at the thought of being compelled to leave You to the mercy of so ruthless a
    successor as <mark class="term correct">Gurgín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. He will, no doubt, discover Your presence in this home, and will, I fear, grievously <mark class="term unknown">ill-treat</mark> You.” “Fear not,”
    remonstrated the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>; “I have <a name="Page_214"></a>committed Myself into the hands of God. My trust is in Him. Such is the power which He has bestowed
    upon Me that if it be My wish, I can convert these very stones into gems of inestimable value, and can instil into the heart of the most wicked criminal
    the loftiest conceptions of uprightness and duty. Of My own will have I chosen to be afflicted by My enemies, <mark class="term unknown">‘that</mark> God might accomplish the thing destined
    to be done.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”<a href="#_ftn208" name="_ftnref208" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> As those precious hours flew by, a sense of overpowering devotion, of
    increased consciousness of nearness to God, filled the heart of the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark>. In his eyes the world’s pomp and pageantry melted away into insignificance
    when brought face to face with the eternal realities enshrined in the Revelation of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. His vision of its glories, its infinite potentialities, its
    incalculable blessings grew in vividness as he increasingly realised the vanity of earthly ambition and the limitations of human endeavour. He continued to
    ponder these thoughts in his heart, until the time when a slight attack of fever, which lasted but one night, suddenly terminated his life. Serene and
    confident, he winged his flight to the Great Beyond.<a href="#_ftn209" name="_ftnref209" title="">[*************]</a>As the life of the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark> was approaching its end, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> summoned to His presence <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Yazdí</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark>, acquainted them with
    the nature of His prediction to His host, and bade them tell the believers who had gathered in the city, to scatter throughout <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, and
    <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, and await whatever Providence, in His wisdom, might choose to decree.
<p></p>A few days after the death of the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark>, a certain person who was aware of the design which he had conceived and carried out for the protection of the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, informed his successor, <mark class="term correct">Gurgín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>,<a href="#_ftn210" name="_ftnref210" title="">[†††††††††††††]</a> of the actual residence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in the
    <mark class="term misspelled">Imárat-i-<u>Kh</u>ur<u>sh</u>íd</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Imárat-i-<u>Kh</u>ur<u>sh</u>íd</mark>, and described to him the honours which his predecessor had lavished upon his Guest in the privacy of his own home. On the
receipt of this unexpected intelligence, <mark class="term correct">Gurgín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> despatched his messenger to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and instructed him to deliver in person the following    <a name="Page_215"></a>message to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>: “Four months ago it was generally believed in <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark> that, in pursuance of your Majesty’s imperial
    summons, the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamídu’d-Dawlih</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamidu’d-Dawlih</mark>, my predecessor, had sent the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> to the seat of your Majesty’s government. It has now been disclosed that this
    same siyyid is actually occupying the <mark class="term misspelled">Imárat-i-<u>Kh</u>ur<u>sh</u>íd</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Imárat-i-<u>Kh</u>ur<u>sh</u>íd</mark>, the private residence of the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamídu’d-Dawlih</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamidu’d-Dawlih</mark>. It has been ascertained that my
    predecessor himself extended the hospitality of his home to the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> and sedulously guarded that secret from both the people and the officials of
    this city. Whatever it pleases your Majesty to decree, I unhesitatingly pledge myself to perform.”
<p></p><p>The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, who was firmly convinced of the loyalty of the <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark>, realised, when he received this message, that the late governor’s sincere
    intention had been to await a favourable occasion when he could arrange a meeting between him and the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and that his sudden death had interfered with
    the execution of that plan. He issued an imperial mandate summoning the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to the capital. In his written message to <mark class="term correct">Gurgín</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>
    commanded him to send the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in disguise, in the company of a mounted escort<a href="#_ftn211" name="_ftnref211" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> headed by
    <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Big-i-<u>Ch</u>apar<u>ch</u>í</mark> <mark class="term correction">Big-i-<u>Ch</u>apár<u>ch</u>í</mark>,<a href="#_ftn212" name="_ftnref212" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> of the sect of the <mark class="term correct">‘Alíyu’lláhí</mark>, to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>; to
exercise the utmost consideration towards Him in the course of His journey, and strictly to maintain the secrecy of His departure.    <a href="#_ftn213" name="_ftnref213" title="">[**************]</a><mark class="term correct">Gurgín</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> went immediately to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and delivered into His hands the written mandate of the sovereign. He then summoned <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Big, conveyed
    to him the behests of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, and ordered him to undertake immediate preparations for the journey. “Beware,” he warned him, “lest anyone
    discover his identity or suspect the nature of your mission. No one but you, not even the members of his escort, should be allowed to recognise him. Should
    anyone question you concerning him, say that he is <a name="Page_216"></a>a merchant whom we have been instructed to conduct to the capital and of whose
    identity we are completely ignorant.” Soon after midnight, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, in accordance with those instructions, set out from the city and proceeded in the
    direction of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. <a name="Page_217"></a>CHAPTER XI: THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>’S STAY IN <mark class="term unknown">KA<u>SH</u>Án</mark>
ON THE eve of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s arrival at <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Jání</mark>, surnamed <mark class="term misspelled">Parpa</mark> <mark class="term correction">Parpá</mark>, a noted resident of that city, dreamed that he was standing at a late
    hour in the afternoon at the gate of <mark class="term misspelled">Attár</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Aṭṭár</mark>, one of the gates of the city, when his eyes suddenly beheld the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> on horseback wearing, instead of His
    customary turban, the <mark class="term correct">kuláh</mark><a href="#_ftn214" name="_ftnref214" title="">[††††††††††††††]</a> usually worn by the merchants of Persia. Before Him, as well
    as behind Him, marched a number of horsemen into whose custody He seemed to have been delivered. As they approached the gate, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> saluted him and said:
    “<mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Jání</mark>, We are to be your Guest for three nights. Prepare yourself to receive Us.”
</p><p>When he awoke, the vividness of his dream convinced him of the reality of his vision. This unexpected apparition constituted in his eyes a providential
    warning which he felt it his duty to heed and observe. He accordingly set out to prepare his house for the reception of the Visitor, and to provide
    whatever seemed necessary for His comfort. As soon as he had completed the preliminary arrangements for the banquet which he had decided to offer the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>
    that night, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Jání</mark> proceeded to the gate of <mark class="term misspelled">Attár</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Aṭṭár</mark>, and there waited for the signs of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s expected arrival. At the appointed hour, as he was
    scanning the horizon, he descried in the distance what seemed to him a company of horsemen <a name="Page_218"></a>approaching the gate of the city. As he
    hastened to meet them, his eyes recognised the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> surrounded by His escort dressed in the same clothes and wearing the same expression as he had seen the
    night before in his dream. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Jání</mark> joyously approached Him and bent to kiss His stirrups. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> prevented him, saying: “We are to be your Guest
    for three nights. <mark class="term unknown">To-morrow</mark> is the day of <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>; we shall celebrate it together in your home.” <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Big, who had been riding close to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>,
    thought Him to be an intimate acquaintance of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Jání</mark>. Turning to him, he said: “I am ready to abide by whatever is the desire of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>.
    I would ask you, however, to obtain the approval of my colleague who shares with me the charge of conducting the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>.” <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Jání</mark>
    submitted his request and was met with a flat refusal. “I decline your suggestion,” he was told. “I have been most emphatically instructed not to allow
this youth to enter any city until his arrival at the capital. I have been particularly commanded to spend the night outside the gate of the city,    <a name="Page_219"></a>to break my march at the hour of sunset, and to resume it the next day at the hour of dawn. I cannot depart from the orders that
    have been given to me.” This gave rise to a heated altercation which was eventually settled in favour of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Big, who succeeded in inducing his
    opponent to deliver the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> into the custody of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Jání</mark> with the express understanding that on the third morning he should safely deliver back his
    Guest into their hands. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Jání</mark>, who had intended to invite to his home the entire escort of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, was advised by Him to abandon this intention.
    “No one but you,” He urged, “should accompany Me to your home.” <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Jání</mark> requested to be allowed to defray the expense of the horsemen’s three <mark class="term unknown">days’</mark>
    stay in <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>. “It is unnecessary,” observed the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>; “but for My will, nothing whatever could have induced them to deliver Me into your hands. All
    things lie prisoned within the grasp of His might. Nothing is impossible to Him. He removes every difficulty and surmounts every obstacle.” The horsemen
    were lodged in a caravanserai in the immediate neighbourhood of the gate of the city. <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Big, following the instructions of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, accompanied Him
    until they drew near the house of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Jání</mark>. Having ascertained the actual situation of the house, he returned and joined his companions.
</p>The night the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> arrived at <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark> coincided with the eve preceding the third <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, after the declaration of His Mission, which fell on the
    second day of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark><mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark>, in the year 1263 A.H.<a href="#_ftn215" name="_ftnref215" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> On that
    same night, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Yazdí</mark>, who had previously, in accordance with the directions of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, come to <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>, was invited to the house of
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Jání</mark> and introduced into the presence of his Master. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was dictating to him a Tablet in honour of His host, when a friend of the latter, a
    certain <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Báqí</mark>, who was noted in <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark> for his learning, arrived. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> invited him to enter, permitted him to hear the verses which
    He was revealing, but refused to disclose His identity. In the concluding passages of the Tablet which He was addressing to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Jání</mark>, He prayed in
    his behalf, supplicated the Almighty to illumine <a name="Page_220"></a>Illustrations: VIEWS OF THE HOUSE OF <mark class="term correct">ḤÁJÍ</mark><mark class="term misspelled">MIRZA</mark><mark class="term correction">MÍRZÁ</mark><mark class="term correct">JÁNÍ</mark> IN <mark class="term unknown">KA<u>SH</u>Án</mark>, SHOWING THE ROOM WHERE THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark> STAYED] <a name="Page_221"></a>his heart with the
    light of Divine knowledge, and to unloose his tongue for the service and proclamation of His Cause. Unschooled and unlettered though he was, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Jání</mark> was able, by virtue of this prayer, to impress with his speech even the most accomplished divine of <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>. He became endowed with such power
    that he was able to silence every idle pretender who dared to challenge the precepts of his Faith. Even the haughty and imperious <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far-i-Naráqí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ja‘far-i-Naráqí</mark> was
    unable, despite his consummate eloquence, to resist the force of his argument, and was compelled to acknowledge outwardly the merits of the Cause of his
    adversary, though at heart he refused to believe in its truth.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Báqí</mark> sat and listened to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. He heard His voice, watched His movements, looked upon the expression of His face, and noted the words
    which streamed unceasingly from His lips, and yet failed to be moved by their majesty and power. Wrapt in the veils of his own idle fancy and learning, he
    was powerless to appreciate the meaning of the utterances of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. He did not even trouble to enquire the name or the character of the Guest into whose
    presence he had been introduced. Unmoved by the things he had heard and seen, he retired from that presence, unaware of the unique opportunity which,
    through his apathy, he had irretrievably lost. A few days later, when informed of the name of the Youth whom he had treated with such careless
    indifference, he was filled with chagrin and remorse. It was too late, however, for him to seek His presence and atone for his conduct, for the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had
    already departed from <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>. In his grief, he renounced the society of his fellowmen, and led, to the end of his days, a life of unrelieved
    seclusion.
<p></p>Among those who were privileged to meet the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in the home of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Jání</mark> was a man named <mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark>, who was destined at a later time, in the year 1268
    A.H.,<a href="#_ftn216" name="_ftnref216" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> to suffer martyrdom in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. He and a few others were, during those three days,
    affectionately entertained by <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Jání</mark>, whose lavish hospitality earned him the praise and commendation of his Master. To even the members of the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s escort he extended the same <mark class="term unknown">loving-kindness</mark>, and, by <a name="Page_222"></a>his liberality and charm of manner, won their lasting gratitude. On the
    morning of the second day after <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, he, mindful of his pledge, delivered the Prisoner into their hands, and, with a heart overflowing with grief, bade
    Him a last and touching farewell. <a name="Page_223"></a>CHAPTER XII: THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>’S JOURNEY FROM <mark class="term unknown">KA<u>SH</u>Án</mark> TO <mark class="term misspelled">TABRIZ</mark><mark class="term correction">TABRÍZ</mark>ATTENDED by His escort, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> proceeded in the direction of <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>.<a href="#_ftn217" name="_ftnref217" title="">[***************]</a> His alluring charm,
    combined with a compelling dignity and unfailing benevolence, had, by this time, completely disarmed and transformed His guards. They seemed to have
    abdicated all their rights and duties and to have resigned themselves to His will and pleasure. In their eagerness to <a name="Page_224"></a>serve and
    please Him, they, one day, remarked: “We are strictly forbidden by the government to allow You to enter the city of <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, and have been ordered to proceed
by an unfrequented route directly to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. We have been particularly directed to keep away from the <mark class="term misspelled">Haram-i-Ma’súmih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥaram-i-Ma‘súmih</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn218" name="_ftnref218" title="">[†††††††††††††††]</a> that inviolable sanctuary under whose shelter the most notorious criminals are immune
    from arrest. We are ready, however, to ignore utterly for Your sake whatever instructions we have received. If it be Your wish, we shall unhesitatingly
    conduct You through the streets of <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark> and enable You to visit its holy shrine.” “<mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> heart of the true believer is the throne of God,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” observed the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>.
    “He who is the ark of salvation and the Almighty’s impregnable stronghold is now journeying with you through this wilderness. I prefer the way of the
    country rather than to enter this unholy city. The immaculate one whose remains are interred within this shrine, her brother, and her illustrious ancestors
    no doubt bewail the plight of this wicked people. With their lips they pay homage to her; by their acts they heap dishonour upon her name. Outwardly they
    serve and reverence her shrine; inwardly they disgrace her dignity.”
<p></p><p>Such lofty sentiments had instilled such confidence in the hearts of those who accompanied the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> that had He at any time chosen to turn away suddenly and
    leave them, no one among His guards would have felt in the least perturbed or would have attempted to pursue Him. Proceeding by a route that skirted the
    northern end of the city of <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, they halted at the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Qumrud</mark> <mark class="term correction">Qumrúd</mark>, which was owned by a relative of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Big, and the inhabitants of which all
    belonged to the sect of the <mark class="term correct">‘Alíyu’lláhí</mark>. At the invitation of the headman of the village, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> tarried one night in that place and was touched by the
warmth and spontaneity of the reception which those simple folk had accorded Him. Ere He resumed His journey, He invoked the blessings of    <a name="Page_225"></a>the Almighty in their behalf and cheered their hearts with assurances of His appreciation and love.
</p>After a march of two days from that village, they arrived, on the afternoon of the eighth day after <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, at the fortress of <mark class="term correct">Kinár-Gird</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn219" name="_ftnref219" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> which lies six <mark class="term correct">farsangs</mark> to the south of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. They were planning to reach the capital
    on the <a name="Page_226"></a>ensuing day, and had decided to spend the night in the neighbourhood of that fortress, when a messenger unexpectedly arrived
    from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, bearing a written order from <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Big. That message instructed him to proceed immediately with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to the village
    of <mark class="term correct">Kulayn</mark>,<a href="#_ftn220" name="_ftnref220" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> where <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-i-Kulayní</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-ibn-i-Ya’qub</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-ibn-i-Ya‘qúb</mark>, the author of
    the <mark class="term misspelled">Usul-i-Káfí</mark><mark class="term correction">Usúl-i-Káfí</mark>, who was born in that place, had been laid to rest with his father, and whose shrines are greatly <a name="Page_227"></a>honoured by the
    people of that neighbourhood.<a href="#_ftn221" name="_ftnref221" title="">[****************]</a><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Big was commanded, in view of the unsuitability
    of the houses in that village, to pitch a special tent for the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and keep the escort in its neighbourhood pending the receipt of further instructions. On
the morning of the ninth day after <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, the eleventh day of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark><mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark>, in the year 1263 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn222" name="_ftnref222" title="">[††††††††††††††††]</a> in the immediate vicinity of that village, which belonged to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, a tent
    which had served for his own use whenever he visited that place was erected for the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, on the slopes of a hill pleasantly situated amid wide stretches of
    orchards and smiling meadows. The peacefulness of that spot, the luxuriance of its vegetation, and the unceasing murmur of its streams greatly pleased the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. He was joined two days after by <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Yazdí</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, his brother; <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark>, and <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Zunúzí</mark>, all of
whom were invited to lodge in the immediate surroundings of His tent. On the fourteenth day of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark><mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn223" name="_ftnref223" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> the twelfth day after <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Mihdíy-i-<u>Kh</u>ú’í</mark><mark class="term correction">Mihdíy-i-<u>Kh</u>u’í</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Mihdíy-i-Kandí</mark> arrived from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. The latter, who had been closely associated with <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, had been commissioned by Him to
    present to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> a sealed letter together with certain gifts which, as soon as they were delivered into His hands, provoked in His soul sentiments of
    unusual delight. His face glowed with joy as He overwhelmed the bearer with marks of His gratitude and favour.
<p></p>That message, received at an hour of uncertainty and suspense, imparted solace and strength to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. It dispelled the gloom that had settled upon His
    heart, and imbued His soul with the certainty of victory. The sadness which had long lingered upon His face, and which the perils of His captivity had
    served to aggravate, visibly diminished. He no longer shed those tears of anguish which had streamed so profusely from His eyes ever since the days of His
    arrest and departure from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. The cry “Beloved, My <mark class="term unknown">Well-Beloved</mark>,” <a name="Page_228"></a>which in His bitter grief and loneliness He was wont to
    utter, gave way to expressions of thanksgiving and praise, of hope and triumph. The exultation which glowed upon His face never forsook Him until the day
    when the news of the great disaster which befell the heroes of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> again beclouded the radiance of His countenance and dimmed the
    joy of His heart.
<p></p>I have heard <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark> recount the following incident: “My companions and I were fast asleep in the vicinity of the tent of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> when the
    trampling of horsemen suddenly awakened us. We were soon informed that the tent of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was vacant and that those who had gone out in search of Him had
    failed to find Him. We heard <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Big remonstrate with the guards. <mark class="term unknown">‘Why</mark> feel disturbed?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he pleaded. <mark class="term unknown">‘Are</mark> not His magnanimity and nobleness of soul
    sufficiently established in your eyes to convince you that He will never, for the sake of His own safety, consent to involve others in embarrassment? He,
    no doubt, must have retired, in the silence of this moonlit night, to a place where He can seek undisturbed communion with God. He will unquestionably
    return to His tent. He will never desert us.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> In his eagerness to reassure his colleagues, <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Big set out on foot along the road leading to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>.
    I, too, with my companions, followed him. Shortly after, the rest of the guards were seen, each on horseback, marching behind us. We had covered about a
    <mark class="term correct">maydán</mark><a href="#_ftn224" name="_ftnref224" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> when, by the dim light of the early dawn, we discerned in the distance the
    lonely figure of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. He was coming towards us from the direction of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. <mark class="term unknown">‘Did</mark> you believe Me to have escaped?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> were His words to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Big as He
    approached him. <mark class="term unknown">‘Far</mark> be it from me,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> was the instant reply as he flung himself at the feet of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, <mark class="term unknown">‘to</mark> entertain such thoughts.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Big was too
    much awed by the serene majesty which that radiant face revealed that morning to venture any further remark. A look of confidence had settled upon His
    countenance, His words were invested with such transcendent power, that a feeling of profound reverence wrapped our very souls. No one dared to question
    Him as to the cause of so remarkable a change in His speech <a name="Page_229"></a>and demeanour. Nor did He Himself choose to allay our curiosity and
    wonder.”
<p></p><p>For a fortnight<a href="#_ftn225" name="_ftnref225" title="">[*****************]</a> the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> tarried in that spot. The tranquillity which He enjoyed amidst
those lovely surroundings was rudely disturbed by the receipt of a letter which <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>    <a href="#_ftn226" name="_ftnref226" title="">[†††††††††††††††††]</a> himself addressed to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and which was <a name="Page_230"></a>composed in these
    terms:<a href="#_ftn227" name="_ftnref227" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> “Much as we desire to meet you, we find ourself unable, in view of our
    immediate departure from our capital, to receive you befittingly in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. We have signified our desire that you be conducted to <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>, and have issued
    the necessary instructions to <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the warden of the castle, to treat you with respect and consideration. It is our hope and intention to
    summon you to this place upon our return to the seat of our government, at <a name="Page_231"></a>which time we shall definitely pronounce our judgment. We
    trust that we have caused you no disappointment, and that you will at no time hesitate to inform us in case any grievances befall you. We fain would hope
that you will continue to pray for our <mark class="term unknown">well-being</mark> and for the prosperity of our realm.” (Dated <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark>, 1263 A.H.)    <a href="#_ftn228" name="_ftnref228" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a>

    address such a communication to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. He was actuated solely by a sense of fear<a href="#_ftn230" name="_ftnref230" title="">[††††††††††††††††††]</a>
    lest <a name="Page_232"></a>the contemplated interview should rob him of his position of unquestioned <mark class="term unknown">pre-eminence</mark> in the affairs of the State and should
lead eventually to his overthrow from power. He entertained no feelings of malice or resentment toward the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. He finally succeeded    <a href="#_ftn231" name="_ftnref231" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> in persuading his sovereign to transfer so dreaded an opponent to a remote and
sequestered corner of his realm, and was thus able to relieve his mind of a thought that continually obsessed him.    <a href="#_ftn232" name="_ftnref232" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> How stupendous was his mistake, how grievous his blunder! Little did he realise, at
    that moment, that by his incessant intrigues he was withholding from his king and country the incomparable benefits of a Divine Revelation which alone had
    the power to deliver the land from the appalling state of degradation into which it had fallen. By his act that <mark class="term unknown">short-sighted</mark> minister did not only
    withhold from <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> the supreme instrument with which he could have rehabilitated a <mark class="term unknown">fast-declining</mark> empire, but also deprived him of that
    spiritual Agency which could have enabled him to establish his undisputed ascendancy over the peoples and nations of the earth. By his folly, his
    extravagance and perfidious counsels, he undermined the foundations of the State, lowered its prestige, sapped the loyalty of his subjects, and plunged
    them into <a name="Page_233"></a>an abyss of misery.<a href="#_ftn233" name="_ftnref233" title="">[*******************]</a> Incapable of being admonished
    by the example of his predecessors, he contemptuously ignored the demands and interests of the people, pursued, with unremitting zeal, his designs for
    personal aggrandisement, and by his profligacy and extravagance involved his country in ruinous wars with its neighbours. <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’d-i-Ma’a<u>dh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘d-i-Ma‘á<u>dh</u></mark>, who was
    neither of royal blood nor invested with authority, attained, through the uprightness of his conduct and his unsparing <a name="Page_234"></a>devotion to
    the Cause of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, so exalted a station that to the present day the chiefs and rulers of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> have continued to reverence his memory and to praise his
    virtues; whereas <mark class="term correct">Buzurg-Mihr</mark>, the ablest, the wisest and most experienced administrator among the <mark class="term unknown">vazírs</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Nu<u>sh</u>iravan-i-’Adil</mark><mark class="term correction">Nú<u>sh</u>íraván-i-‘Ádil</mark>, in spite of his
    commanding position, eventually was publicly disgraced, was thrown into a pit, and became the object of the contempt and the ridicule of the people. He
    bewailed his plight and wept so bitterly that he finally lost his sight. Neither the example of the former nor the fate of the latter seemed to have
awakened that <mark class="term unknown">self-confident</mark> minister to the perils of his own position. He persisted in his thoughts until he too forfeited his rank, lost his riches,    <a href="#_ftn234" name="_ftnref234" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††]</a> and sank into abasement and shame. The numerous properties which he forcibly seized
    from the humble and <mark class="term unknown">law-abiding</mark> subjects of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, the costly furnitures with which he embellished them, the vast expenditures of labour and
    treasure which he ordered for their improvement—all were irretrievably lost two years after he had issued his decree condemning the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to a cruel
    incarceration in the inhospitable mountains of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>. All his possessions were confiscated by the State. He himself was disgraced by his
    sovereign, was ignominiously expelled from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, and fell a prey to disease and poverty. Bereft of hope and sunk in misery, he languished in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>
    until the hour of his death.<a href="#_ftn235" name="_ftnref235" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><a name="Page_235"></a>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was accordingly ordered to proceed to <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>.<a href="#_ftn236" name="_ftnref236" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> The same escort, under the
    command of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Big, attended Him on His journey to the northwestern province of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>. He was allowed to select one companion and one
    attendant from among His followers to be with Him during His sojourn in that province. He selected <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Yazdí</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, his brother. He
    refused to expend on Himself the funds provided by the government for the expense of that journey. All the allowances that were given by the State He
    bestowed upon the poor and needy, and devoted to His own private needs the money which He, as a merchant, had earned in <mark class="term correct">Bú<u>sh</u>ihr</mark> and <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>.
    As orders had been given to avoid entering the towns in the course of the journey to <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, a number of the believers of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, informed of the approach
    of their beloved Leader, set out for the village of <mark class="term correct">Síyáh-Dihán</mark><a href="#_ftn237" name="_ftnref237" title="">[********************]</a> and were there able
    to meet Him.
<p></p>One of them was <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Iskandar</mark>, who had been delegated by <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> to visit the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, and to investigate His Cause. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> commissioned him
    to deliver the following message to <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark><mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Af<u>sh</u>ar</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Af<u>sh</u>ár</mark>, who was a great admirer of the late <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>: “He whose virtues the late
    siyyid unceasingly extolled, and to the approach of whose Revelation he continually alluded, is now revealed. I am that promised One. Arise and deliver Me
    from the hand of the oppressor.” When the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> entrusted this message to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Iskandar</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was in <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> and was preparing to leave for
    <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. Within the space of three days, that message reached him. He failed, however, to respond to that appeal. <a name="Page_236"></a>Two days later, a friend of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Iskandar</mark> had acquainted <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, who, at the instigation of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, had been incarcerated in the capital,
    with the appeal of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> immediately instructed the believers of his native city to undertake whatever preparations were required and to collect
    the necessary forces to achieve the deliverance of their Master. He urged them to proceed with caution and to attempt, at an appropriate moment, to seize
    and carry Him away to whatever place He might desire. These were shortly joined by a number of believers from <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, who set out, according to
    the directions of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, to execute the plan. They overtook the guards at the hour of midnight and, finding them fast asleep, approached the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and
    begged Him to flee. “The mountains of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark> too have their claims,” was His confident reply as He lovingly advised them to abandon their
    project and return to their homes.<a href="#_ftn238" name="_ftnref238" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††]</a><p></p>Approaching the gate of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Big, feeling that the hour of his separation from his Prisoner was at hand, besought His presence and with tearful
    eyes begged Him to overlook his shortcomings and transgressions. “The journey from <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>,” he said, “has been long and arduous. I have failed to do my
    duty and to serve You as I ought. I crave Your forgiveness, and pray You to vouchsafe me Your blessings.” “Be assured,” the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> replied, “I account you a
member of My fold. They who embrace My Cause will eternally bless and glorify you, will extol your conduct and exalt your name.”    <a href="#_ftn239" name="_ftnref239" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> The rest of the guards followed the <a name="Page_237"></a>example of their chief,
    implored the blessings of their Prisoner, kissed His feet, and with tears in their eyes bade Him a last farewell. To each the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> expressed His
    appreciation of his devoted attentions and assured him of His prayers in his behalf. Reluctantly they delivered Him into the hands of the governor of
    <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, the heir to the throne of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>. To those with whom they were subsequently brought in contact, these devoted attendants of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>
    and <mark class="term unknown">eye-witnesses</mark> of His superhuman wisdom and power, recounted with awe and admiration the tale of those wonders which they had seen and heard, and by
    this means helped to diffuse in their own way the knowledge of the new Revelation.
<p></p>The news of the approaching arrival of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> at <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> bestirred the believers in that city. They all set out to meet Him, eager to extend to so beloved
    a Leader their welcome. The officials of the government into whose custody the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was to be delivered refused to allow them to draw near and to receive
    His blessings. One youth, however, unable to restrain himself, rushed forth barefooted, through the gate of the city, and, in his impatience to gaze upon
    the face of his Beloved, ran out a distance of half a <mark class="term correct">farsang</mark><a href="#_ftn240" name="_ftnref240" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> towards Him. As he
    approached the horsemen who were marching in advance of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, he joyously welcomed them and, seizing <a name="Page_238"></a>the hem of the garment of
    one among them, devoutly kissed his stirrups. “Ye are the companions of my <mark class="term unknown">Well-Beloved</mark>,” he tearfully exclaimed. “I cherish you as the apple of my eye.”
    His extraordinary behaviour, the intensity of his emotion, amazed them. They immediately granted him his request to attain the presence of his Master. As
    soon as his eyes fell upon Him, a cry of exultation broke from his lips. He fell upon his face and wept profusely. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> dismounted from His horse, put
    His arms around him, wiped away his tears, and soothed the agitation of his heart. Of all the believers of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, that youth alone succeeded in offering
    his homage to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and in being blessed by the touch of His hand. All the others had perforce to content themselves with a distant glimpse of their
    Beloved, and with that view sought to satisfy their longing.
<p></p>When the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> arrived at <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, He was conducted to one of the chief houses in that city, which had been reserved <a name="Page_239"></a>for His
    confinement.<a href="#_ftn241" name="_ftnref241" title="">[*********************]</a> A detachment of the <mark class="term correct">Náṣirí</mark> regiment stood guard at the entrance of
    His house. With the exception of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and his brother, neither the public nor His followers were allowed to meet Him. This same regiment, which
    had been recruited from among the inhabitants of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>amsíh</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>amsih</mark>, and upon which special honours had been conferred, was subsequently chosen to discharge
    the volley that caused His death. The circumstances of His arrival had stirred the people in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> profoundly. A tumultuous concourse of people had
    gathered to witness His entry into the city.<a href="#_ftn242" name="_ftnref242" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††]</a> Some were impelled by curiosity,
    others were earnestly desirous of ascertaining the veracity of the wild reports that were current about Him, and still others were moved by their faith and
    devotion to attain His presence and to assure Him of their loyalty. As He walked along the streets, the acclamations of the multitude resounded on every
side. The great majority of the people who beheld His face greeted Him with the shout of “<mark class="term correct">Alláh-u-Akbar</mark>,”    <a href="#_ftn243" name="_ftnref243" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> others loudly glorified and cheered Him, a few invoked upon Him the blessings of
    the Almighty, others were seen to kiss reverently the dust of His footsteps. Such was the clamour which His arrival had raised that a crier was ordered to
    warn the populace of the danger that awaited those who ventured to seek His presence. “Whosoever shall make any attempt to approach the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>,” went
    forth the cry, “or seek to meet him, all his possessions shall forthwith be seized and he himself condemned to perpetual imprisonment.”
<p></p><p>On the day after the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s arrival, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-Taqíy-i-Milání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-Taqíy-i-Mílání</mark>, a noted merchant of the city, ventured, together with <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-‘Askar</mark>, to interview the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. They were warned by their friends and <mark class="term unknown">well-wishers</mark> that by such an attempt they would not only be risking the loss of their <a name="Page_240"></a>possessions but would also be endangering their lives. They refused, however, to heed such counsels. As they approached the door of the house in which the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was confined, they were immediately arrested. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, who at that moment was coming out from the presence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, instantly intervened. “I am
    commanded by the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>,” he vehemently protested, “to convey to you this message: <mark class="term unknown">‘Suffer</mark> these visitors to enter, inasmuch as I Myself have invited
    them to meet Me.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” I have heard <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-‘Askar</mark> testify to the following: “This message immediately silenced the opposers. We were straightway ushered
    into His presence. He greeted us with these words: <mark class="term unknown">‘These</mark> miserable wretches who watch at the gate of My house have been destined by Me as a protection
    against the inrush of the multitude who throng around the house. They are powerless to prevent those whom I desire to meet from attaining My presence.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> For
    about two hours, we tarried with Him. As He dismissed us, He entrusted me with two cornelian ringstones, instructing me to have carved on them the two
    verses which He had previously given to me; to have them mounted and brought to Him as soon as they were ready. He assured us that at whatever time we
    desired to meet Him, no one would hinder our admittance to His presence. Several times I ventured to go to Him in order to ascertain His wish regarding
    certain details connected with the commission with which He had entrusted me. Not once did I encounter the slightest opposition on the part of those who
    were guarding the entrance of His house. Not one offensive word did they utter against me, nor did they seem to expect the slightest remuneration for their
    indulgence.
</p>“I recall how, in the course of my association with <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, I was impressed by the many evidences of his perspicacity and extraordinary power. I was
    privileged to accompany him on his journey from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, and visited with him the towns of <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Tabas</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabas</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Bu<u>sh</u>rúyih</mark>, and
    <mark class="term correct">Turbat</mark>. I deplored in those days the sadness of my failure to meet the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. <mark class="term unknown">‘Grieve</mark> not,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> confidently assured me; <mark class="term unknown">‘the</mark>
Almighty is no doubt able to compensate you in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> for the loss you have sustained in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. Not once, but seven times, can He enable you    <a name="Page_241"></a>to partake of the joy of His presence, in return for the one visit which you have missed.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I was amazed at the confidence with which
    he uttered those words. Not until the time of my visit to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, when, despite adverse circumstances, I was, on several occasions, admitted
    into His presence, did I recall those words of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and marvel at his remarkable foresight. How great was my surprise when, on my seventh visit to
    the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, I heard Him speak these words: <mark class="term unknown">‘Praise</mark> be to God, who has enabled you to complete the number of your visits and who has extended to you His loving
    protection.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” <a name="Page_242"></a>Illustration: THE CASTLE OF <mark class="term correct">MÁH-KÚ</mark>] <a name="Page_243"></a>CHAPTER XIII: THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>’S INCARCERATION IN THE CASTLE OF <mark class="term correct">MÁH-KÚ</mark><mark class="term correct">SIYYID</mark><mark class="term correct">ḤUSAYN-I-YAZDÍ</mark> has been heard to relate the following: “During the first ten days of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s incarceration in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, no one knew what would next
    befall Him. The wildest conjectures were current in the city. One day I ventured to ask Him whether He would continue to remain where He was or would be
    transferred to still another place. <mark class="term unknown">‘Have</mark> you forgotten,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> was His immediate reply, <mark class="term unknown">‘the</mark> question you asked me in <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>? For a period of no less than nine
    months, we shall remain confined in the <mark class="term misspelled">Jabál-i-Basít</mark><mark class="term correction">Jabal-i-Básiṭ</mark>,<a href="#_ftn244" name="_ftnref244" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> from whence we shall be
    transferred to the <mark class="term misspelled">Jabál-i-<u>Sh</u>adíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Jabal-i-<u>Sh</u>adíd</mark>.<a href="#_ftn245" name="_ftnref245" title="">[**********************]</a> Both these places are among the
    mountains of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>úy</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>uy</mark> and are situated on either side of the town bearing that name.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Five days after the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had uttered this prediction, orders were
    issued to transfer Him and me to the castle of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark> and to deliver us into the custody of <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Máh-Kú’í</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>an-i-Máh-Kú’í</mark>.”
<p></p><p>The castle, a solid, <mark class="term unknown">four-towered</mark> stone edifice, occupies the summit of a mountain at the foot of which lies the town of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>. The only road that leads
    from it passes into that town, ending at a gate which adjoins the seat of government and is invariably kept closed. This gate is distinct from that of the
    castle itself. Situated on the confines of both the Ottoman and Russian empires, this castle has been used, in view of its commanding position and
    strategic advantages, as a centre for reconnoitring purposes. The officer in charge of that station observed, in time of war, the movements of the enemy,
    surveyed the surrounding regions, and reported to his government such cases of emergency as came <a name="Page_244"></a>under his observation. The castle
    is bounded on the west by the river Araxes, which marks the frontier between the territory of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and the Russian empire. To the south extends
the territory of the <mark class="term correct">Sulṭán</mark> of Turkey; the frontier town of <mark class="term correct">Báyazíd</mark> being at a distance of only four <mark class="term correct">farsangs</mark>    <a href="#_ftn246" name="_ftnref246" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> from the mountain of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>. The frontier officer, in charge of the castle, was
a man named <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. The residents of the town are all Kurds and belong to the <mark class="term correct">sunní</mark> sect of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn247" name="_ftnref247" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> The <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ahs</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ahs</mark>, who constitute the vast majority of the inhabitants of
    Persia, have always been their avowed and bitter enemies. These Kurds particularly abhor the siyyids of the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark> denomination, whom they regard as
    the spiritual leaders and chief agitators among their opponents. <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>’s mother being a Kurd, the son was held in great esteem and was
    implicitly obeyed by the people of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>. They regarded him as a member of their own community and placed the utmost confidence in him.
</p><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark> had deliberately contrived to relegate the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to so remote, so inhospitable and dangerously situated a corner of the territory of the    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, with the sole purpose of stemming the tide of His rising influence and of severing every tie that bound Him to the body of His disciples
    throughout the country. Confident that few, if any, would venture to penetrate that wild and turbulent region, occupied by so rebellious a people, he
    fondly imagined that this forced seclusion of his Captive from the pursuits and interests of His followers would gradually tend to stifle the Movement at
    its very birth and would lead to its final extinction.<a href="#_ftn248" name="_ftnref248" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> He was soon made to
    realise, however, that he had gravely mistaken the nature of the Revelation of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and had underrated the force of its influence. The turbulent spirits
    of this unruly people were soon subdued by the gentle manners of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and their hearts were softened <a name="Page_245"></a>by the ennobling influence
    of His love. Their pride was humbled by His unexampled modesty, and their unreasoning arrogance mellowed by the wisdom of His words. Such was the fervour
    which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had kindled in those hearts that their first act, every morning, was to seek a place whence they could catch a glimpse of His face, where
    they could commune with Him and beseech His blessings upon their daily work. In cases of dispute, they would instinctively hasten to that spot and, with
    their gaze fixed upon His prison, would invoke His name and adjure one another to declare the truth. <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> several times attempted to induce
    them to desist from this practice but found himself powerless to restrain their enthusiasm. He discharged his functions with the utmost severity and
refused to allow any of the avowed disciples of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to reside, even for one night, in the town of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn249" name="_ftnref249" title="">[***********************]</a>“For the first two weeks,” <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> further related, “no one was permitted to visit the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. My brother and I alone were admitted to His presence.
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> would, every day, accompanied by one of the guards, descend to the town and purchase our daily necessities. <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Zunúzí</mark>, who had arrived at <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>, spent the nights in a <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> outside the gate of the town. He acted as an intermediary between those of the
    followers of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> who occasionally visited <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, my brother, who would in turn submit the petitions of the believers to their Master
    and would acquaint <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> with His reply. <a name="Page_246"></a>“One day the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> charged my brother to inform <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> that He would Himself request <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> to alter his attitude towards the
    believers who visited <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark> and to abandon his severity. <mark class="term unknown">‘Tell</mark> him,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He added, <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> will <mark class="term unknown">to-morrow</mark> instruct the warden to conduct him to this place.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I was
    greatly surprised at such a message. How could the domineering and <mark class="term unknown">self-willed</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, I thought to myself, be induced to relax the severity of
    his discipline? Early the next day, the gate of the castle being still closed, we were surprised by a sudden knock at the door, knowing full well that
    orders had been given that no one was to be admitted before the hour of sunrise. We recognised the voice of <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who seemed to be
    expostulating with the guards, one of whom presently came in and informed me that the warden of the castle insisted on being allowed admittance into the
    presence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. I conveyed his message and was commanded to usher him at once into His presence. As I was stepping out of the door of His antechamber,
    I found <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> standing at the threshold in an attitude of complete submission, his face betraying an expression of unusual humility and wonder.
    His <mark class="term unknown">self-assertiveness</mark> and pride seemed to have entirely vanished. Humbly and with extreme courtesy, he returned my salute and begged me to allow him to
    enter the presence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. I conducted him to the room which my Master occupied. His limbs trembled as he followed me. An inner agitation which he
    could not conceal <a name="Page_247"></a>brooded over his face. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> arose from His seat and welcomed him. Bowing reverently, <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>
    approached and flung himself at His feet. <mark class="term unknown">‘Deliver</mark> me,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he pleaded, <mark class="term unknown">‘from</mark> my perplexity. I adjure You, by the Prophet of God, Your illustrious Ancestor, to
    dissipate my doubts, for their weight has <mark class="term unknown">well-nigh</mark> crushed my heart. I was riding through the wilderness and was approaching the gate of the town, when,
    it being the hour of dawn, my eyes suddenly beheld You standing by the side of the river engaged in offering Your prayer. With outstretched arms and
    upraised eyes, You were invoking the name of God. I stood still and watched You. I was waiting for You to terminate Your devotions that I might approach
    and rebuke You for having ventured to leave the castle without my leave. In Your communion with God, You seemed so wrapt in worship that You were utterly
    forgetful of Yourself. I quietly approached You; in Your state of rapture, You remained wholly unaware of my presence. I was suddenly seized with great
    fear and recoiled at the thought of awakening You from Your ecstasy. I decided to leave You, to proceed to the guards and to reprove them for their
    negligent conduct. I soon found out, to my amazement, that both the outer and inner gates were closed. They were opened at my request, I was ushered into
    Your presence, and now find You, to my wonder, seated before me. I am utterly confounded. I know not whether my reason has deserted me.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> answered
    and said: <mark class="term unknown">‘What</mark> you have witnessed is true and undeniable. You belittled this Revelation and have contemptuously disdained its Author. God, the
    <mark class="term unknown">All-Merciful</mark>, desiring not to afflict you with His punishment, has willed to reveal to your eyes the Truth. By His Divine interposition, He has instilled
    into your heart the love of His chosen One, and caused you to recognise the unconquerable power of His Faith.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p>This marvellous experience completely changed the heart of <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. Those words had calmed his agitation and subdued the fierceness of his
    animosity. By every means in his power, he determined to atone for his past behaviour. <mark class="term unknown">‘A</mark> poor man, a <u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>, he hastily informed the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>,
    “is yearning to attain Your presence. He lives in a <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> outside the gate of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>. I pray You that I myself be <a name="Page_248"></a>allowed to bring
    him to this place that he may meet You. By this act I hope that my evil deeds may be forgiven, that I may be enabled to wash away the stains of my cruel
    behaviour toward Your friends.” His request was granted, whereupon he went straightway to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Zunúzí</mark> and conducted him into the
    presence of his Master.
</p><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> set out, within the limits imposed upon him, to provide whatever would tend to alleviate the rigour of the captivity of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. At night
    the gate of the castle was still closed; in the daytime, however, those whom the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> desired to see were allowed to enter His presence, were able to
    converse with Him and to receive His instructions.
<p></p>As He lay confined within the walls of the castle, He devoted His time to the composition of the Persian <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark>, the most weighty, the most illuminating and
    comprehensive of all His works.<a href="#_ftn250" name="_ftnref250" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> In it He laid down the laws and precepts of His
    Dispensation, plainly and emphatically announced the advent of a subsequent Revelation, and persistently urged His followers to seek and find “Him whom God
    would make manifest,”<a href="#_ftn251" name="_ftnref251" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> warning them lest they allow the mysteries and allusions
in the <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark> to interfere with their recognition of His Cause.<a href="#_ftn252" name="_ftnref252" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><a name="Page_249"></a>I have heard <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Zunúzí</mark> bear witness to the following: “The voice of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, as He dictated the teachings and principles of His
    Faith, could be clearly heard by those who were dwelling at the foot of the mountain. The melody of His chanting, the rhythmic flow of the verses which
    streamed from His lips caught our ears and penetrated into our very souls. Mountain and valley <mark class="term unknown">re-echoed</mark> the majesty of His voice. Our hearts vibrated in
    their depths to the appeal of His utterance.”<a href="#_ftn253" name="_ftnref253" title="">[************************]</a><a name="Page_250"></a>The gradual relaxation of the stern discipline imposed upon the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> encouraged an increasing number of His disciples from the different provinces of Persia
    to visit Him in the castle of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>. An unceasing stream of eager and devout pilgrims was directed to its gates through the gentleness and leniency of
    <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>.<a href="#_ftn254" name="_ftnref254" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> After a stay of three days, they would invariably be
    dismissed by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, with instructions to return to their respective fields of service and to resume their labours for the consolidation of His Faith.
    <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><a name="Page_251"></a><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> himself never failed to pay his respects to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> each Friday, and to assure Him of his unswerving loyalty and
    devotion. He often presented Him with the rarest and choicest fruit available in the neighbourhood of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>, and would continually offer Him such
    delicacies as he thought would prove agreeable to His taste and liking.
<p></p>In this manner the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> spent the summer and autumn within the walls of that castle. A winter followed of such <a name="Page_252"></a>exceptional severity
    that even the copper implements were affected by the intensity of the cold. The beginning of that season coincided with the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark> of the year
    1264 A.H.<a href="#_ftn255" name="_ftnref255" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> The water which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> used for His ablutions was of such icy
    coldness that its drops glistened as they froze upon His face. He would invariably, after the termination of each prayer, summon <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> to His
    presence and would request him to read aloud to Him a passage from the <mark class="term misspelled">Muhriqu’l-Qulub</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥriqu’l-Qulúb</mark>, a work composed by the late <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark>, the <mark class="term unknown">great-grandfather</mark>
    of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Kamálu’d-Dín-i-Naráqí</mark>, in which the author extols the virtues, laments the death, and narrates the circumstances of the martyrdom of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. The recital of those sufferings would provoke intense emotion in the heart of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. His tears would keep flowing as He listened to the tale of
    the unutterable indignities heaped upon him, and of the agonising pain which he was made to suffer at the hands of a perfidious enemy. As the circumstances
    of that tragic life were unfolded before Him, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was continually reminded of that still greater tragedy which was destined to signalise the advent of
    the promised <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. To Him those past atrocities were but a symbol which foreshadowed the bitter afflictions which His own beloved <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was soon to
    suffer at the hands of His countrymen. He wept as He pictured in His mind those calamities which He who was to be made manifest was predestined to suffer,
calamities such as the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, even in the midst of his agonies, was never made to endure.    <a href="#_ftn256" name="_ftnref256" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><a name="Page_253"></a>In one of His writings revealed in the year <mark class="term unknown">’</mark>60 A.H., the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> declares the following: “The spirit of prayer which animates My soul is the direct
consequence of a dream which I had in the year before the declaration of My Mission. In My vision I saw the head of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, the <mark class="term unknown">Siyyidu’<u>sh</u></mark>-    <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>uhada’</mark>, which was hanging upon a tree. Drops of blood dripped profusely from His lacerated throat. With feelings of unsurpassed delight, I
    approached that tree and, stretching forth My hands, gathered a few drops of that sacred blood, and drank them devoutly. When I awoke, I felt that the
    Spirit of God had permeated and taken possession of My soul. My heart was thrilled with the joy of His Divine presence, and the mysteries of His Revelation
    were unfolded before My eyes in all their glory.”
<p></p><p>No sooner had <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> condemned the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to captivity amid the mountain fastnesses of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark> <mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark> than he became afflicted with a sudden
    reverse of fortune, such as he had never known before and which struck at the very foundations of his State. Appalling disaster surprised his forces that
    were engaged in maintaining internal order throughout the provinces.<a href="#_ftn257" name="_ftnref257" title="">[*************************]</a> The
    standard of rebellion was <a name="Page_254"></a>hoisted in <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, and so great was the consternation provoked by that rising that the projected
    campaign of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Hirát</mark> was immediately abandoned. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>’s recklessness and prodigality had fanned into flame the smouldering fires
    of discontent, had exasperated the masses and encouraged them to stir up sedition and mischief. The most turbulent elements in <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> that
inhabited the regions of <mark class="term misspelled">Quchán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Qú<u>ch</u>án</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Bujnurd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Bujnúrd</mark>, and <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íraván</mark> leagued themselves with the <mark class="term misspelled">Salar</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sálár</mark>, son of the <mark class="term misspelled">Asifu’d-Dawlih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áṣifu’d-Dawlih</mark>, the elder maternal uncle of the    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and governor of the province, and repudiated the authority of the central government. Whatever forces were despatched from the capital met with
    immediate defeat at the hands of the chief instigators of the rebellion. <mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ja‘far-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Namdar</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>an-i-Námdár</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark> <mark class="term correct">Arslán</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, son of the <mark class="term misspelled">Salar</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sálár</mark>,
    who conducted the operations against the forces of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, displayed the utmost cruelty and, having repulsed the attacks of the enemy, mercilessly
    put their captives to death.
</p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was at that time residing at <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>,<a href="#_ftn258" name="_ftnref258" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> and was
    endeavouring, despite the tumult which that revolt had occasioned, to spread the knowledge of the new Revelation. No sooner had he discovered that the
    <mark class="term misspelled">Salar</mark><mark class="term correction">Sálár</mark>, in his desire to extend the scope of the rebellion, had determined to approach him and obtain his support, than he promptly decided to leave the
    city in order to avoid implicating himself <a name="Page_255"></a>self in the plots of that proud and rebellious chief. In the dead of night, with only
    <mark class="term correct">Qambar-‘Alí</mark> as his attendant, he proceeded on foot in the direction of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, from which place he was determined to visit <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>, where he
    hoped to meet the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. His friends, when they learned of the manner of his departure, immediately provided whatever would be conducive to the comforts of
    his long and arduous journey and hastened to overtake him. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> declined their help. “I have vowed,” he said, “to walk the whole distance that
    separates me from my Beloved. I shall not relax in my resolve until I shall have reached my destination.” He even tried to induce <mark class="term correct">Qambar-‘Alí</mark> to return to
    <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, but was finally obliged to yield to his entreaty to allow him to act as his servant throughout his pilgrimage to <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>.
<p></p>On his way to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was enthusiastically greeted by the believers in the different towns through which he passed. They addressed to him the
    same request and received from him the same reply. I have heard the following testimony from the lips of <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark>: “When <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> arrived at
    <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, I, together with a large number of believers, went to visit him. He seemed to us the very embodiment of constancy, of piety and virtue. He inspired
    us with his rectitude of conduct and passionate loyalty. Such were the force of his character and the ardour of his faith that we felt convinced that he,
    unaided and alone, would be capable of achieving the triumph of the Faith of God.” He was, with secrecy, ushered into the presence of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, and,
    soon after his interview, proceeded to <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>.
<p></p>The night before his arrival at <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>, which was the eve of the fourth <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark> after the declaration of the <a name="Page_256"></a>Mission of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and
    which fell in that year, the year 1264 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn259" name="_ftnref259" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> on the thirteenth of the month of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark><mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark>, <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> dreamed a dream. “In my sleep,” he thus relates his story, “I was startled by the sudden intelligence that
    <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, the Prophet of God, was soon to arrive at <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>, that He was to proceed directly to the castle in order to visit the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and to offer Him His
    congratulations on the advent of the <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark> festival. In my dream, I ran out to meet Him, eager to extend to so holy a Visitor the expression of my humble
    welcome. In a state of indescribable gladness, I hastened on foot in the direction of the river, and as I reached the bridge, which lay at a distance of a
    <mark class="term correct">maydán</mark><a href="#_ftn260" name="_ftnref260" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> from the town of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>, I saw two men advancing towards me. I thought
    one of them to be the Prophet Himself, while the other who walked behind Him I supposed to be one of His distinguished companions. I hastened to throw
    myself at His feet, and was bending to kiss the hem of His robe, when I suddenly awoke. A great joy had flooded my soul. I felt as if Paradise itself, with
    all its delights, had been crowded into my heart. Convinced of the reality of my vision, I performed my ablutions, offered my prayer, arrayed myself in my
    richest attire, anointed myself with perfume, and proceeded to the spot where, the night before in my dream, I had gazed upon the countenance of the
    Prophet. I had instructed my attendants to saddle three of my best and swiftest steeds and to conduct them immediately to the bridge. The sun had just
    risen when, alone and unescorted, I walked out of the town of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark> in the direction of the river. As I approached the bridge, I discovered, with a throb
    of wonder, the two men whom I had seen in my dream walking one behind the other, and advancing towards me. Instinctively I fell at the feet of the one whom
    I believed to be the Prophet, and devoutly kissed them. I begged Him and His companion to mount the horses which I had prepared for their entry into
    <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>. <mark class="term unknown">‘Nay</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> was His reply, <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> have vowed to accomplish the whole of my journey on foot. I will walk to the summit of this mountain and will there visit
    your Prisoner.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p>This strange experience of <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> brought about a <a name="Page_257"></a>deepening of reverence in his attitude towards the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. His faith in the
    potency of His Revelation became even greater, and his devotion to Him was vastly increased. In an attitude of humble surrender, he followed <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
    until they reached the gate of the castle. As soon as the eyes of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> fell upon the countenance of his Master, who was seen standing at the
    threshold of the gate, he halted instantly and, bowing low before Him, stood motionless by His side. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> stretched forth His arms and affectionately
    embraced him. Taking him by the hand, He conducted him to His chamber. He then summoned His friends into His presence and celebrated in their company the
    feast of <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>. Dishes of sweetmeats and of the choicest fruits had been spread before Him. He distributed them among His assembled friends, and as He
offered some of the quinces and apples to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, He said: “These luscious fruits have come to us from <mark class="term misspelled">Milán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mílán</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Ard-i-Jannat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Arḍ-i-Jannat</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn261" name="_ftnref261" title="">[**************************]</a> and have been specially plucked and consecrated to this feast by the
    <mark class="term misspelled">Ismu’lláhu’l-Fatiq</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ismu’lláhu’l-Fatíq</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>.”
</p><p>Until that time no one of the disciples of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> but <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Yazdí</mark> and his brother had been allowed to spend the night within the castle. That
    day <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> went to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and said: “If it be Your desire to retain <a name="Page_258"></a><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> with You this night, I am ready to abide
    by Your wish, for I have no will of my own. However long You desire him to stay with You, I pledge myself to carry out Your command.” The disciples of the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> continued to arrive in increasing numbers at <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>, and were immediately and without the least restriction admitted to His presence.
</p>One day, as the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, in the company of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, was looking out over the landscape of the surrounding country from the roof of the castle, He gazed
    towards the west and, as He saw the Araxes winding its course far away below Him, turned to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and said: “That is the river, and this is the bank
    thereof, of which the poet <mark class="term misspelled">Háfiz</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥáfiẓ</mark> has thus written: <mark class="term unknown">‘O</mark> zephyr, shouldst thou pass by the banks of the Araxes, implant a kiss on the earth of that valley and
    make fragrant thy breath. Hail, a thousand times hail, to thee, O abode of <mark class="term misspelled">Salma</mark><mark class="term correction">Salmá</mark>! How dear is the voice of thy <mark class="term unknown">camel-drivers</mark>, how sweet the jingling of thy
    bells!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn262" name="_ftnref262" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> The days of your stay in this country are approaching their end. But
    for the shortness of your stay, we would have shown you the <mark class="term unknown">‘abode</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Salma</mark><mark class="term correction">Salmá</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> even as we have revealed to your eyes the <mark class="term unknown">‘banks</mark> of the Araxes.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” By the
    “abode of <mark class="term misspelled">Salma</mark><mark class="term correction">Salmá</mark>” the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> meant the town of Salmas, which is situated in the neighbourhood of <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark> and which the Turks designate as Salmas.
    Continuing His remarks, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> said: “It is the immediate influence of the Holy Spirit that causes words such as these to stream from the tongue of poets,
    the significance of which they themselves are oftentimes unable to apprehend. The following verse is also divinely inspired: <mark class="term misspelled">‘<u>Sh</u>íráz</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> will be thrown
    into a tumult; a Youth of <mark class="term unknown">sugar-tongue</mark> will appear. I fear lest the breath of His mouth should agitate and upset <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The mystery enshrined
within this verse is now concealed; it will be revealed in the year after <mark class="term misspelled">Ḥin</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥín</mark>.”    <a href="#_ftn263" name="_ftnref263" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> subsequently quoted this <mark class="term unknown">well-known</mark> tradition: “Treasures lie hidden
    beneath the throne <a name="Page_259"></a>of God; the key to those treasures is the tongue of poets.” He then, one after the other, related to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
those events which must needs transpire in the future, and bade him not to mention them to anyone.    <a href="#_ftn264" name="_ftnref264" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> “A few days after your departure from this place,” the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> informed him,
    “they will transfer Us to another mountain. Ere you arrive at your destination, the news of Our departure from <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark> will have reached you.”
<p></p><p>The prediction which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had uttered was promptly fulfilled. Those who had been charged to watch secretly the movements and conduct of <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>
    submitted to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark> a detailed report in which they expatiated upon his extreme devotion to his Prisoner and described such incidents as tended
    to confirm their statements. “Day and night,” they wrote him, “the warden of the castle of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark> is to be seen associating with his captive in conditions
    of unrestrained freedom and friendliness. <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who obstinately refused to wed his daughter with the heir to the throne of Persia, pleading
    that such an act would so infuriate the <mark class="term correct">sunní</mark> relatives of his mother that they would unhesitatingly put him and his daughter to death, now with the
    keenest eagerness desires that same daughter to be espoused to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. The latter has refused, but <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> still persists in his entreaty. But
    for the prisoner’s refusal, the nuptials of the maiden would have been already celebrated.” <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> had actually made such a request and had even
    begged <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> to intercede in his behalf with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> but had failed to obtain His consent.
</p>These malevolent reports had an immediate influence upon <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>. Fear and resentment again impelled that capricious minister to issue a
    peremptory order for the transference of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to the castle of <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>.
<p></p>Twenty days after <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> bade farewell to the people of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>, who, in the course of His nine <mark class="term unknown">months’</mark> captivity, had recognised to a remarkable
    degree the power <a name="Page_260"></a>of His personality and the greatness of His character. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who had already, at the bidding of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>,
    departed from <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>, was still in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> when the news of his Master’s predicted transference to <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark> reached him. As the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> bade His last
    farewell to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, He addressed him in these words: “You have walked on foot all the way from your native province to this place. On foot you
    likewise must return until you reach your destination; for your days of horsemanship are yet to come. You are destined to exhibit such courage, such skill
    and heroism as shall eclipse the mightiest deeds of the heroes of old. Your daring exploits will win the praise and admiration of the dwellers in the
    eternal Kingdom. You should visit, on your way, the believers of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>úy</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>uy</mark>, of <mark class="term correct">Urúmíyyih</mark>, of <mark class="term correct">Mará<u>gh</u>ih</mark>, of <mark class="term misspelled">Milán</mark><mark class="term correction">Mílán</mark>, of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>,
    and of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. To each you will convey the expression of My love and tender affection. You will strive to inflame their hearts anew with the fire of the
    love of the Beauty of God, and will endeavour to fortify their faith in His Revelation. From <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> you should proceed to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, where God’s hidden
    treasure will be made manifest to you. You will be called upon to perform deeds so great as will dwarf the mightiest achievements of the past. The nature
    of your task will, in that place, be revealed to you, and strength and guidance will be bestowed upon you that you may be fitted to render your service to
    His Cause.”
<p></p><p>On the morning of the ninth day after <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> set forth, as bidden by his Master, on his journey to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>. To <mark class="term correct">Qambar-‘Alí</mark> the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>
addressed these parting words: “The <mark class="term correct">Qambar-‘Alí</mark> of a bygone age would glory in that his namesake has lived to witness a Day for which even He    <a href="#_ftn265" name="_ftnref265" title="">[***************************]</a> who was the Lord of his lord sighed in vain; of which He, with keen
    longing, has spoken: <mark class="term unknown">‘Would</mark> that My eyes could behold the faces of My brethren who have been privileged to attain unto His Day!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” <a name="Page_261"></a>CHAPTER XIV: <mark class="term misspelled">MULLA</mark> <mark class="term correction">MULLÁ</mark> <mark class="term correct">ḤUSAYN</mark>’S JOURNEY TO <mark class="term correct">MÁZINDARÁN</mark>
<mark class="term correct">‘ALÍ</mark> <mark class="term unknown"><u>KH</u>ÁN</mark> cordially invited <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> to tarry a few days in his home before his departure from <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>. He expressed a keen desire to provide
every facility for his journey to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>. The latter, however, refused to delay his departure or to avail himself of the means of comfort which <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>    <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> had so devotedly placed at his disposal.
</p>He, faithful to the instructions he had received, stopped at every town and village that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had directed him to visit, gathered the faithful, conveyed
    to them the love, the greetings, and the assurances of their beloved Master, quickened afresh their zeal, and exhorted them to remain steadfast in His way.
    In <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> he was again privileged to enter the presence of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and to receive from His hands that spiritual sustenance which enabled him, with such
    undaunted courage, to brave the perils that so fiercely assailed the closing days of his life.
<p></p>From <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> proceeded to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> in eager expectation of witnessing the revelation of the hidden treasure promised to him by his Master.
    <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> was at that time living in <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> in the home which had originally belonged to his own father. He freely associated with all classes of
    people, and by the gentleness of his character and the wide range of his learning had won the affection and unqualified admiration of the inhabitants of
    that town. Upon his arrival in that city, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> went directly to the home of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and was affectionately received by him. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> himself waited
    upon his guest, and did his utmost to provide whatever seemed necessary for his comfort. With his own hands he removed the dust, and washed the blistered
    skin of his feet. He offered him the seat of honour in the company of his assembled friends, and introduced, with <a name="Page_262"></a>extreme reverence,
    each of the believers who had gathered to meet him.
<p></p>On the night of his arrival, as soon as the believers who had been invited to dinner to meet <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had returned to their homes, the host, turning to
    his guest, enquired whether he would enlighten him more particularly regarding his intimate experiences with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in the castle of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>. “Many and
    diverse,” replied <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, “were the things which I heard and witnessed in the course of my nine <mark class="term unknown">days’</mark> association with Him. He spoke to me of things
    relating both directly and indirectly to His Faith. He gave me, however, no definite directions as to the course I should pursue for the propagation of His
    Cause. All He told me was this: <mark class="term unknown">‘On</mark> your way to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, you should visit the believers in every town and village through which you pass. From <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> you
    should proceed to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, for there lies a hidden treasure which shall be revealed to you, a treasure which will unveil to your eyes the character of
    the task you are destined to perform.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> By His allusions I could, however dimly, perceive the glory of His Revelation and was able to discern the signs of
    the future ascendancy of His Cause. From His words I gathered that I should eventually be called upon to sacrifice my unworthy self in His path. For on
    previous occasions, whenever dismissing me from His presence, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> would invariably assure me that I should again be summoned to meet Him. This time,
    however, as He spoke to me His parting words, He gave me no such promise, nor did He allude to the possibility of my ever meeting Him again face to face in
    this world. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> Feast of Sacrifice,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> were His last words to me, <mark class="term unknown">‘is</mark> fast approaching. Arise and gird up the loin of endeavour, and let nothing detain you
    from achieving your destiny. Having attained your destination, prepare yourself to receive Us, for We too shall ere long follow you.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> enquired whether he had brought with him any of his Master’s writings, and, on being informed that he had none with him, presented his guest with
    the pages of a manuscript which he had in his possession, and requested him to read certain of its passages. As soon as he had read a page of that
    manuscript, his countenance underwent a <a name="Page_263"></a>sudden and complete change. His features betrayed an undefinable expression of admiration
    and surprise. The loftiness, the profundity—above all, the penetrating influence of the words he had read, provoked intense agitation in his heart and
    called forth the utmost praise from his lips. Laying down the manuscript, he said: “I can well realise that the Author of these words has drawn His
    inspiration from that Fountainhead which stands immeasurably superior to the sources whence the learning of men is ordinarily derived. I hereby testify to
    my <mark class="term unknown">whole-hearted</mark> recognition of the sublimity of these words and to my unquestioned acceptance of the truth which they reveal.” From the silence which
    <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> observed, as well as from the expression which his countenance betokened, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> concluded that no one else except his host could have penned
    those words. He instantly arose from his seat and, standing with bowed head at the threshold of the door, reverently declared: “The hidden treasure of
    which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> has spoken, now lies unveiled before my eyes. Its light has dispelled the gloom of perplexity and doubt. Though my Master be now hidden amid
    the mountain fastnesses of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark> <mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>, the sign of His splendour and the revelation of His might stand manifest before me. I have found in
    <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> the reflection of His glory.”
</p><p>How grave, how appalling the mistake of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>! This foolish minister had vainly imagined that by condemning the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to a life of hopeless exile
    in a remote and sequestered corner of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark> <mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>, he would succeed in concealing from the eyes of his countrymen that Flame of God’s undying Fire.
    Little did he perceive that by setting up the Light of God upon a hill, he was helping to diffuse its radiance and to proclaim its glory. By his own acts,
    by his amazing miscalculations, instead of hiding that heavenly Flame from the eyes of men, he gave it still further prominence and helped to excite its
    glow. How fair, on the other hand, was <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and how keen and sure his judgment! Of those who had known and seen him, none could for one moment
    question the erudition of this youth, his charm, his high integrity and amazing courage. Had he, after the death of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, declared himself the
    promised <a name="Page_264"></a><mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>, the most distinguished among his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> would have unanimously acknowledged his claim and submitted to his
    authority. Had not <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-i-Mamaqání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-i-Mámáqání</mark>, that noted and learned disciple of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aḥmad-i-Ahsá’í</mark> <mark class="term correction">Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í</mark>, after he was made acquainted in
    <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> with the claims of the new Revelation, declared: “I take God as my witness! Had this claim which the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> has made been
    advanced by this same <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> I would, in view of his remarkable traits of character and breadth of knowledge, have been the first to champion his
    cause and to proclaim it to all people. As he, however, has chosen to subordinate himself to another person, I have ceased to have any confidence in his
    words and have refused to respond to his appeal.” Had not <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term unknown">Muḥammad-Báqir-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark>, when he heard <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> so ably resolve the
    perplexities which had long afflicted his mind, testified in such glowing terms to his high attainments: “I, who fondly imagined myself capable of
    confounding and silencing <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark>, realised, when I first met and conversed with him who claims to be only his humble disciple, how
    grievously I had erred in my judgment. Such is the strength with which this youth seems endowed that if he were to declare the day to be night, I would
    still believe him able to deduce such proofs as would conclusively demonstrate, in the eyes of the learned divines, the truth of his statement.”
</p><p>On the very night he was brought in contact with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, though at first conscious of his own infinite superiority and predisposed to
    belittle the claims advanced by the son of an obscure merchant of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, did not fail to perceive, as soon as his Host had begun to unfold His
    theme, the incalculable benefits latent in His Revelation. He eagerly embraced His Cause and disdainfully abandoned whatever might hamper his own efforts
    for the proper understanding and the effective promotion of its interests. And when, in due course, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was given the opportunity of appreciating
    the transcendent sublimity of the writings of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, he, with his usual sagacity and unerring judgment, was likewise able to estimate the true worth and
    merit of those special gifts with which both the person and the utterance <a name="Page_265"></a>of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> were endowed. The vastness of his own acquired
    knowledge dwindled into insignificance before the <mark class="term unknown">all-encompassing</mark>, the <mark class="term unknown">God-given</mark> virtues which the spirit of this youth displayed. That very moment, he
    pledged his undying loyalty to him who so powerfully mirrored forth the radiance of his own beloved Master. He felt it to be his first obligation to
    subordinate himself entirely to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, to follow in his footsteps, to abide by his will, and to ensure by every means in his power his welfare and safety.
    Until the hour of his martyrdom, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> remained faithful to his pledge. In the extreme deference which he henceforth showed to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, he was solely
    actuated by a firm and unalterable conviction of the reality of those supernatural gifts which so clearly distinguished him from the rest of his
    <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>. No other consideration induced him to show such deference and humility in his behaviour towards one who seemed to be but his equal. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>’s keen insight swiftly apprehended the magnitude of the power that lay latent in him, and the nobility of his character impelled him to demonstrate
    befittingly his recognition of that truth.
</p>Such was the transformation wrought in the attitude of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> towards <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> that the believers who gathered the next morning at his house were
    extremely surprised to find that the guest who the night before had occupied the seat of honour, and upon whom had been lavished such kindness and
    hospitality, had given his seat to his host and was now standing, in his place, at the threshold in an attitude of complete humility. The first words
    which, in the company of the assembled believers, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> addressed to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> were the following: “Now, at this very hour, you should arise and, armed
    with the rod of wisdom and of might, silence the host of evil plotters who strive to discredit the fair name of the Faith of God. You should face that
    multitude and confound their forces. You should place your reliance upon the grace of God, and should regard their machinations as a futile attempt to
    obscure the radiance of the Cause. You should interview the <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>, that notorious and <mark class="term unknown">false-hearted</mark> tyrant, and should fearlessly disclose to
his eyes the distinguishing features of this Revelation. From thence you should proceed to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. In the town <a name="Page_266"></a>of Ma    <u>sh</u>had, you should build a house so designed as both to serve for our private residence and at the same time afford adequate facilities for the
    reception of our guests. Thither we shall shortly journey, and in that house we shall dwell. To it you shall invite every receptive soul who we hope may be
    guided to the River of everlasting life. We shall prepare and admonish them to band themselves together and proclaim the Cause of God.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> set out the next day at the hour of sunrise to interview the <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>. Alone and unaided, he sought his presence and conveyed to him,
    as bidden by <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, the Message of the new Day. With fearlessness and eloquence, he pleaded, in the midst of the assembled disciples, the Cause of his
    beloved Master, called upon him to demolish those idols which his own idle fancy had carved and to plant upon their shattered fragments the standard of
    Divine guidance. He appealed to him to disentangle his mind from the fettering creeds of the past, and to hasten, free and untrammelled, to the shores of
    eternal salvation. With characteristic vigour, he defeated every argument with which that specious sorcerer sought to refute the truth of the Divine
    Message, and exposed, by means of his unanswerable logic, the fallacies of every doctrine that he endeavoured to propound. Assailed by the fear lest the
    congregation of his disciples should unanimously rally round the person of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> had recourse to the meanest of devices, and
    indulged in the most abusive language in the hope of safeguarding the integrity of his position. He hurled his calumnies into the face of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>,
    and, contemptuously ignoring the proofs and testimonies adduced by his opponent, confidently asserted, without the least justification on his part, the
    futility of the Cause he had been summoned to embrace. No sooner had <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> realised his utter incapacity to apprehend the significance of the
    Message he had brought him than he arose from his seat and said: “My argument has failed to rouse you from your sleep of negligence. My deeds will in the
    days to come prove to you the power of the Message you have chosen to despise.” He spoke with such vehemence and emotion that the <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> was
    utterly confounded. <a name="Page_267"></a>Such was the consternation of his soul that he was unable to reply. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> then turned to a member of that
    audience who seemed to have felt the influence of his words, and charged him to relate to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> the circumstances of this interview. “Say to him,” he
    added: “<mark class="term unknown">‘Inasmuch</mark> as you did not specifically command me to seek your presence, I have determined to set out immediately for <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. I proceed to
    carry out in their entirety those things which you have instructed me to perform.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
</p><p>Alone and with a heart wholly detached from all else but God, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> set out on his journey to <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>. His only companion, as he trod his way
    to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, was the thought of accomplishing faithfully the wishes of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, and his one sustenance the consciousness of his unfailing promise. He
    went directly to the home of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir-i-Qá’iní</mark>, and was soon able to buy, in the neighbourhood of that house in <mark class="term misspelled">Bálá-<u>Kh</u>iyabán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Bálá-<u>Kh</u>íyábán</mark>, a tract
    of land on which he began to erect the house which he had been commanded to build, and to which he gave the name of <mark class="term correct">Bábíyyih</mark>, a name that it bears to the
    present day. Shortly after it was completed, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> arrived at <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark> and abode in that house. A steady stream of visitors, whom the energy and
    zeal of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had prepared for the acceptance of the Faith, poured into the presence of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, acknowledged the claim of the Cause, and willingly
    enlisted under its banner. The <mark class="term unknown">all-observing</mark> vigilance with which <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> laboured to diffuse the knowledge of the new Revelation, and the masterly
    manner in which <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> edified its <mark class="term unknown">ever-increasing</mark> adherents, gave rise to a wave of enthusiasm which swept over the entire city of <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, and the
    effects of which spread rapidly beyond the confines of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. The house of <mark class="term correct">Bábíyyih</mark> was soon converted into a rallying centre for a multitude of
devotees who were fired with an inflexible resolve to demonstrate, by every means in their power, the great inherent energies of their Faith.    <a name="Page_268"></a>CHAPTER XV: <mark class="term misspelled">TÁHIRIH</mark> <mark class="term correction">ṬÁHIRIH</mark>’S JOURNEY FROM <mark class="term correct">KARBILÁ</mark> TO <mark class="term unknown"><u>KH</u>URÁSÁN</mark>
AS THE appointed hour approached when, according to the dispensations of Providence, the veil which still concealed the fundamental verities of the Faith
    was to be rent asunder, there blazed forth in the heart of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> a flame of such consuming intensity that the most formidable obstacles standing
in the way of the ultimate recognition of the Cause melted away and vanished.    <a href="#_ftn266" name="_ftnref266" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> That fire caused such a conflagration in the hearts of men that the effects
    of its quickening power were felt in the most outlying provinces of Persia. It obliterated every trace of the misgivings and doubts which had still
    lingered in the hearts of the believers, and had hitherto hindered them from apprehending the full measure of its glory. The decree of the enemy had
    condemned to perpetual isolation Him who was the embodiment of the beauty of God, and sought thereby to quench for all time the flame of His love. The hand
    of Omnipotence, however, was busily engaged, at a time when the host of <mark class="term unknown">evil-doers</mark> were darkly plotting against Him, in confounding their schemes and in
    nullifying their efforts. In the easternmost province of Persia, the Almighty had, through the hand of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, lit a fire that glowed with the hottest
    flame in the breasts of the people of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. And in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, beyond the western confines of that land, He had kindled the light of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>, a
    light that was destined to shed its radiance upon the whole of Persia. From the east <a name="Page_269"></a>and from the west of that country, the voice of
    the Unseen summoned those twin great lights to hasten to the land of <mark class="term misspelled">Tá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭá</mark>,<a href="#_ftn267" name="_ftnref267" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> the
    <mark class="term unknown">day-spring</mark> of glory, the home of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. He bade them each seek the presence, and revolve round the person of that <mark class="term unknown">Day-Star</mark> of Truth, to seek His
    advice, to reinforce His efforts, and to prepare the way for His coming Revelation.
</p>In pursuance of the Divine decree, in the days when <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> was still residing in <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, there was revealed from the pen of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> a Tablet
addressed to all the believers of Persia, in which every loyal adherent of the Faith was enjoined to “hasten to the Land of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>á</mark>,” the province of    <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>.<a href="#_ftn268" name="_ftnref268" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> The news of this high injunction spread with marvellous
    rapidity and aroused universal enthusiasm. It reached the ears of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>, who, at that time, was residing in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> and was bending every effort to
    extend the scope of the Faith she had espoused.<a href="#_ftn269" name="_ftnref269" title="">[****************************]</a> She had left her native
    town of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> and had arrived, after the death of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, at that holy city, in eager expectation of witnessing the signs which the departed siyyid
    had foretold. In the foregoing pages we have seen how instinctively she had been led to discover the Revelation of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and how spontaneously she had
    acknowledged its truth. Unwarned and uninvited, she perceived the dawning light of the promised Revelation breaking upon the city of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, and was
    prompted to pen her message and plead her fidelity to Him who was the Revealer of that light.
<p></p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s immediate response to her declaration of faith which, without attaining His presence, she was moved to make, animated her zeal and vastly
    increased her courage. She arose to spread abroad His teachings, vehemently denounced the corruption and perversity of her generation, and fearlessly
advocated a fundamental revolution in the habits <a name="Page_270"></a>and manners of her people.    <a href="#_ftn270" name="_ftnref270" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> Her indomitable spirit was quickened by the fire of her love for the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>,
    and the glory of her vision was further enhanced by the discovery of the inestimable blessings latent in His Revelation. The innate fearlessness and the
    strength of her character were reinforced a hundredfold by her immovable conviction of the ultimate victory of the Cause she had embraced; and her
    boundless energy was revitalised by her recognition of the abiding value of the Mission she had risen to champion. All who met her in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> were ensnared
    by her bewitching eloquence and felt the fascination of her words. None could resist her charm; few could escape the contagion of her belief. All testified
    to the extraordinary traits of her character, marvelled at her amazing personality, and were convinced of the sincerity of her convictions.
<p></p>She was able to win to the Cause the revered widow of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, who was born in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, and was the first among the women of <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> to
    recognise its truth. I have heard <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Sulṭán</mark> describe her extreme devotion to <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>, whom she revered as her spiritual guide and
    esteemed as her affectionate companion. He was also a fervent admirer of the character of the widow of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>, to whose gentleness of manner he often
    paid a glowing tribute. “Such was her attachment to <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>,” <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Sulṭán</mark> was often heard to remark, “that she was extremely reluctant to
    allow that heroine who was a guest in her house to absent herself, though it were for an hour, from her presence. So great an attachment on her part did
    not fail to excite the curiosity and quicken the faith of her women friends, both Persian and Arab, who were constant visitors in her home. In the first
    year of her acceptance of the Message, she suddenly <a name="Page_271"></a>fell ill, and after the lapse of three days, as had been the case with <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, she departed this life.”
<p></p><p>Among the men who in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> eagerly embraced, through the efforts of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>, the Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, was a certain <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Ṣáliḥ</mark>, an Arab
    resident of that city who was the first to shed his blood in the path of the Faith, in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. She was so profuse in her praise of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Ṣáliḥ</mark> that a few suspected him of being equal in rank to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>. <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulṭán</mark> was also among those who fell under the spell of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>. On
    his return from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, he identified himself with the Faith, boldly and assiduously promoted its interests, and did his utmost to execute her
    instructions and wishes. Another admirer was <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-<u>Sh</u>ibl</mark>, the father of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Muṣṭafá</mark>, an Arab native of <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>
    who ranked high among the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of that city. By the aid of this chosen band of staunch and able supporters, <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> was able to fire the imagination and
    to enlist the allegiance of a considerable number of the Persian and Arab inhabitants of <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, most of whom were led by her to join forces with those of
    their brethren in Persia who were soon to be called upon to shape by their deeds the destiny, and to seal with their <mark class="term unknown">life-blood</mark> the triumph, of the Cause
    of God.
</p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s appeal, which was originally addressed to His followers in Persia, was soon transmitted to the adherents of His Faith in <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>. <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>
    gloriously responded. Her example was followed immediately by a large number of her faithful admirers, all of whom expressed their readiness to journey
    forthwith to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. The <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> sought to dissuade her from undertaking that journey. Perceiving immediately the motive which prompted
    them to tender her such advice, and aware of their malignant design, she addressed to each of these sophists a lengthy epistle in which she set forth her
    motives and exposed their dissimulation.<a href="#_ftn271" name="_ftnref271" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><a name="Page_272"></a>From <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> she proceeded to <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>.<a href="#_ftn272" name="_ftnref272" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> A representative delegation,
    consisting of the ablest leaders among the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">sunní</mark>, the Christian and Jewish communities of that city, sought her presence and endeavoured
    to convince her of the folly of her actions. She was able, however, to silence their protestations, and astounded them with the force of her argument.
Disillusioned and confused, they retired, deeply conscious of their own impotence.    <a href="#_ftn273" name="_ftnref273" title="">[*****************************]</a>The <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Kirman<u>sh</u>áh</mark><mark class="term correction">Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh</mark> respectfully received her and presented her with various tokens of their esteem and admiration.<a href="#_ftn274" name="_ftnref274" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> In <mark class="term correct">Hamadán</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn275" name="_ftnref275" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> however, the ecclesiastical leaders <a name="Page_273"></a>of the city
    were divided in their attitude towards her. A few sought privily to provoke the people and undermine her prestige; others were moved to extol openly her
    virtues and applaud her courage. “It behoves us,” these friends declared from their pulpits, “to follow her noble example and reverently to ask her to
    unravel for us the mysteries of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> and to resolve the intricacies of the holy Book. For our highest attainments are but a drop compared to the
    immensity of her knowledge.” While in <mark class="term correct">Hamadán</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> was met by those whom her father, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣáliḥ</mark>, had sent from <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> to welcome and urge her, on
    his behalf, to visit her native town and prolong her stay in their midst.<a href="#_ftn276" name="_ftnref276" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a>
She reluctantly consented. Ere she departed, she bade those who had accompanied her from <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark> to proceed to their native land. Among them were <u>Sh</u>ay    <u>kh</u><mark class="term correct">Sulṭán</mark>, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-<u>Sh</u>ibl</mark> and his youthful son, <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Muṣṭafá</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Abid</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Ábid</mark> and his son <mark class="term misspelled">Náṣir</mark><mark class="term correction">Naṣír</mark>, who subsequently was given
    the name of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abbás</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás</mark>. Those of her companions who had been living in Persia, such as <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term unknown">Muḥammad-i-Gulpaygání</mark>, whose <mark class="term unknown">pen-name</mark> was <mark class="term misspelled">Ta’ir</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭá’ir</mark>, and whom
    <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> had styled <mark class="term misspelled">Fata’l-Malih</mark><mark class="term correction">Fata’l-Malíḥ</mark>, and others were also bidden to return to their homes. Only two of her companions remained with her—<mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣáliḥ</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Ibráhím-i-Gulpaygání</mark>, both of whom quaffed the cup of martyrdom, the first in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and the other in <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>. Of her own kinsmen, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>, one of the Letters of the Living and her <mark class="term unknown">brother-in-law</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Hádí</mark>, who had been betrothed to her daughter, travelled with her
    all the way from <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>.
<p></p>On her arrival at the house of her father, her cousin, the haughty and <mark class="term unknown">false-hearted</mark><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, son of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, who esteemed himself, next to his
    father and his uncle, the most accomplished of all the <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> of Persia, sent certain ladies of his own household to persuade <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> to transfer her
    residence from her father’s house to his own. “Say to my presumptuous and arrogant kinsman,” was her bold reply to the messengers: “<mark class="term unknown">‘If</mark> your desire had
    really been to be a faithful mate and companion to me, you would have hastened to meet me in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> and would on foot have <a name="Page_274"></a>Illustrations: HOUSES IN WHICH <mark class="term misspelled">TÁHIRIH</mark><mark class="term correction">ṬÁHIRIH</mark> LIVED IN <mark class="term correct">QAZVÍN</mark>] <a name="Page_275"></a>guided my howdah    <a href="#_ftn277" name="_ftnref277" title="">[******************************]</a> all the way to <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>. I would, while journeying with you, have aroused
    you from your sleep of heedlessness and would have shown you the way of truth. But this was not to be. Three years have elapsed since our separation.
    Neither in this world nor in the next can I ever be associated with you. I have cast you out of my life for ever.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p>So stern and unyielding a reply roused both <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> and his father to a burst of fury. They immediately pronounced her a heretic, and strove day and
night to undermine her position and to sully her fame. <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> vehemently defended herself and persisted in exposing the depravity of their character.    <a href="#_ftn278" name="_ftnref278" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> Her father, a <mark class="term unknown">peace-loving</mark> and <mark class="term unknown">fair-minded</mark> <a name="Page_276"></a>man,
    deplored this acrimonious dispute and endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation and harmony between them, but failed in his efforts.
</p>This state of tension continued until the time when a certain <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’lláh</mark>, a native of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> and fervent admirer of both <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, arrived in <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> at the beginning of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Ramadán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ramaḍán</mark>, in the year 1263 A.H.    <a href="#_ftn279" name="_ftnref279" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> Subsequently, in the course of his trial in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, in the presence of
    the <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhib-Diván</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥib-Díván</mark>, this same <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’lláh</mark> recounted the following: “I have never been a convinced <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>. When I arrived at <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, I was on my way to
    <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>, intending to visit the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and investigate the nature of His Cause. On the day of my arrival at <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, I became aware that the town was in a great
    state of turmoil. As I was passing through the <mark class="term unknown">market-place</mark>, I saw a crowd of ruffians who had stripped a man of his <mark class="term unknown">head-dress</mark> and shoes, had wound his
    turban around his neck, and by it were dragging him through the streets. An angry multitude was tormenting him with their threats, their blows and curses.
    <mark class="term unknown">‘His</mark> unpardonable guilt,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I was told in answer to my enquiry, <mark class="term unknown">‘is</mark> that he has dared to extol in public the virtues of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. Accordingly, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjatu’l-Islám</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjatu’l-Islám</mark>, has pronounced him a heretic and decreed his expulsion from the town.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p>I was amazed at the explanation given me. How could a <mark class="term correct"><u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í</mark>, I thought to myself, be regarded as a heretic and be deemed worthy of such
    cruel treatment? Desirous of ascertaining from <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> himself the truth of this report, I betook myself to his school and asked whether he had actually
    pronounced such a condemnation against him. <mark class="term unknown">‘Yes</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he bluntly replied, <mark class="term unknown">‘the</mark> god whom the late <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aḥmad-i-Bahrayní</mark> <mark class="term correction">Aḥmad-i-Baḥrayní</mark> worshipped is a god in
    whom I can never believe. Him as well as his followers I regard as the very embodiments of error.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I was moved that very moment to smite his face in the
    presence of his assembled disciples. I restrained myself, however, and vowed that, God willing, I would pierce his lips with my spear so that he would
    never be again able to utter such blasphemy.
</p>“I straightway left his presence and directed my steps <a name="Page_277"></a>towards the market, where I bought a dagger and a <mark class="term unknown">spear-head</mark> of the sharpest
    and finest steel. I concealed them in my bosom, ready to gratify the passion that burned within me. I was waiting for my opportunity when, one night, I
    entered the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> in which he was wont to lead the congregation in prayer. I waited until the hour of dawn, at which time I saw an old woman enter the
<mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>, carrying with her a rug, which she spread over the floor of the <mark class="term misspelled">mihrab</mark><mark class="term correction">miḥráb</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn280" name="_ftnref280" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> Soon after, I saw <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> enter alone, walk to the <mark class="term misspelled">mihrab</mark><mark class="term correction">miḥráb</mark>, and offer
    his prayer. Cautiously and quietly, I followed him and stood behind him. He was prostrating himself on the floor, when I rushed upon him, drew out my
    <mark class="term unknown">spear-head</mark>, and plunged it into the back of his neck. He uttered a loud cry. I threw him on his back and, unsheathing my dagger, drove it <mark class="term unknown">hilt-deep</mark> into
    his mouth. With the same dagger, I struck him at several places in his breast and side, and left him bleeding in the <mark class="term misspelled">mihrab</mark><mark class="term correction">miḥráb</mark>.
<p></p>“I ascended immediately the roof of the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> and watched the frenzy and agitation of the multitude. A crowd rushed in and, placing him upon a litter,
    transported him to his house. Unable to identify the murderer, the people seized the occasion to gratify their basest instincts. They rushed at one
    another’s throats, violently attacked and mutually accused one another in the presence of the governor. Finding out that a large number of innocent people
    had been gravely molested and thrown into prison, I was impelled by the voice of my conscience to confess my act. I accordingly besought the presence of
    the governor and said to him: <mark class="term unknown">‘If</mark> I deliver into your hands the author of this murder, will you promise me to set free all the innocent people who are
    suffering his place?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> No sooner had I obtained from him the necessary assurance than I confessed to him that I had committed the deed. He was not disposed
    at first to believe me. At my request, he summoned the old woman who had spread the rug in the <mark class="term misspelled">mihrab</mark><mark class="term correction">miḥráb</mark>, but refused to be convinced by the evidence which
    she gave. I was finally conducted to the bedside of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, who was on the point of death. As soon as he saw me, he recognised my features. In his
    agitation, he pointed with his finger to <a name="Page_278"></a>me, indicating that I had attacked him. He signified his desire that I be taken away from
    his presence. Shortly after, he expired. I was immediately arrested, was convicted of murder, and thrown into prison. The governor, however, failed to keep
    his promise and refused to release the prisoners.”
<p></p><p>The candour and sincerity of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’lláh</mark> greatly pleased the <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhib-Diván</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥib-Díván</mark>. He gave secret orders to his attendants to enable him to escape from prison.
    At the hour of midnight, the prisoner took refuge in the home of <mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Sardár</mark>, who had recently been married to the sister of the <mark class="term misspelled">Sipah-Salar</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sipah-Sálár</mark>,
    and remained concealed in that house until the great struggle or <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, when he determined to throw in his lot with the heroic
    defenders of the fort. He, as well as <mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who followed him to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, quaffed eventually the cup of martyrdom.
</p>The circumstances of the murder fanned to fury the wrath of the lawful heirs of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, who now determined to wreak their vengeance upon <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>. They
    succeeded in having her placed in the strictest confinement in the house of her father, and charged those women whom they had selected to watch over her,
    not to allow their captive to leave her room except for the purpose of performing her daily ablutions. They accused her of really being the instigator of
    the crime. “No one else but you,” they asserted, “is guilty of the murder of our father. You issued the order for his assassination.” Those whom they had
arrested and confined were conducted by them to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and were incarcerated in the home of one of the <mark class="term correct">kad-<u>kh</u>udás</mark><a href="#_ftn281" name="_ftnref281" title="">[*******************************]</a> of the capital. The friends and heirs of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> scattered
    themselves in all directions, denouncing their captives as the repudiators of the law of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> and demanding that they be immediately put to death.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> who was at that time residing in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, was informed of the plight of these prisoners who had been the companions and supporters of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>.
    As He was already acquainted with the <mark class="term correct">kad-<u>kh</u>udá</mark> in whose home they were incarcerated, He decided to visit them and intervene in their behalf. That
    avaricious and deceitful official, who was fully aware of the extreme generosity of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, greatly exaggerated <a name="Page_279"></a>in the hope of
    deriving a substantial pecuniary advantage for himself, the misfortune that had befallen the unhappy captives. “They are destitute of the barest
    necessities of life,” urged the <mark class="term correct">kad-<u>kh</u>udá</mark>. “They hunger for food, and their clothing is wretchedly scanty.” <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> extended immediate financial
    assistance for their relief, and urged the <mark class="term correct">kad-<u>kh</u>udá</mark> to relax the severity of the rule under which they were confined. The latter consented to
    relieve a few who were unable to support the oppressive weight of their chains, and for the rest did whatever he could to alleviate the rigour of their
    confinement. Prompted by greed, he informed his superiors of the situation, and emphasised the fact that both food and money were being regularly supplied
    by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> for those who were imprisoned in his house.
<p></p>These officials were in their turn tempted to derive every possible advantage from the liberality of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. They summoned Him to their presence,
    protested against His action, and accused Him of complicity in the act for which the captives had been condemned. “The <mark class="term correct">kad-<u>kh</u>udá</mark>,” replied
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, “pleaded their cause before Me and enlarged upon their sufferings and needs. He himself bore witness to their innocence and appealed to Me for
    help. In return for the aid which, in response to his invitation, I was impelled to extend, you now charge Me with a crime of which I am innocent.” Hoping
    to intimidate <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> by threatening immediate punishment, they refused to allow Him to return to His home. The confinement to which He was subjected
    was the first affliction that befell <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in the path of the Cause of God; the first imprisonment He suffered for the sake of His loved ones. He
    remained in captivity for a few days, until <mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ja‘far-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the brother of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Núrí</mark>, who at a later time was appointed Grand
    <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, and a number of other friends intervened in His behalf and, threatening the <mark class="term correct">kad-<u>kh</u>udá</mark> in severe a language, were able to
    effect His release. Those who had been responsible for His confinement had confidently hoped to receive, in return for His deliverance, the sum of one
    thousand <mark class="term misspelled">túmans</mark><mark class="term correction">túmáns</mark>,<a href="#_ftn282" name="_ftnref282" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> but they soon found out that they were forced to comply
    with the wishes of <mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ja‘far-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> without <a name="Page_280"></a>the hope of receiving, either from him or from <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, the slightest reward.
    With profuse apologies and with the utmost regret, they surrendered their Captive into his hands.
<p></p>The heirs of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> were in the meantime bending every effort to avenge the blood of their distinguished kinsman. Unsatisfied with what they had
    already accomplished, they directed their appeal to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> himself, and endeavoured to win his sympathy to their cause. The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> is
    reported to have returned this answer: “Your father, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, surely could not have claimed to be superior to the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, the Commander of the
    Faithful. Did not the latter instruct his disciples that, should he fall a victim to the sword of <mark class="term correct">Ibn-i-Muljam</mark>, the murderer alone should, by his death, be
    made to atone for his act, that no one else but he should be put to death? Why should not the murder of your father be similarly avenged? Declare to me his
    murderer, and I will issue my orders that he be delivered into your hands in order that you may inflict upon him the punishment which he deserves.”
<p></p><p>The uncompromising attitude of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> induced them to abandon the hopes which they had cherished. They declared <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Ṣáliḥ</mark> to be
    the murderer of their father, obtained his arrest, and ignominiously put him to death. He was the first to shed his blood on Persian soil in the path of
    the Cause of God; the first of that glorious company destined to seal with their <mark class="term unknown">life-blood</mark> the triumph of God’s holy Faith. As he was being conducted to
    the scene of his martyrdom, his face glowed with zeal and joy. He hastened to the foot of the gallows and met his executioner as if he were welcoming a
    dear and lifelong friend. Words of triumph and hope fell unceasingly from his lips. “I discarded,” he cried, with exultation, as his end approached, “the
    hopes and the beliefs of men from the moment I recognised Thee, Thou who art my Hope and my Belief!” His remains were interred in the courtyard of the
    shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám-Zádih</mark> <mark class="term correct">Zayd</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>.
</p>The unsatiable hatred that animated those who had been responsible for the martyrdom of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣáliḥ</mark> impelled them to seek additional
    instruments for the furtherance of their designs. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, whom the <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhib-Diván</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥib-Díván</mark> had succeeded in convincing of the treacherous conduct of the
    heirs <a name="Page_281"></a>of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, refused to entertain their appeal. Undeterred by his refusal, they submitted their case to the <mark class="term misspelled">Sadr-i-Ardibílí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣadr-i-Ardibílí</mark>,
    a man notoriously presumptuous and one of the most arrogant among the ecclesiastical leaders of Persia. “Behold,” they pleaded, “the indignity that has
    been inflicted upon those whose supreme function it is to keep guard over the integrity of the Law. How can you, who are its chief and illustrious
    exponent, allow so grave an affront to its dignity to remain unpunished? Are you really incapable of avenging the blood of that slaughtered minister of the
    Prophet of God? Do you not realise that to tolerate such a heinous crime would in itself unloose a flood of calumny against those who are the chief
    repositories of the teachings and principles of our Faith? Will not your silence embolden the enemies of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> to shatter the structure which your own
    hands have reared? As a result, will not your own life be endangered?”
<p></p><p>The <mark class="term misspelled">Sadr-i-Ardibílí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣadr-i-Ardibílí</mark> was sore afraid, and in his impotence sought to beguile his sovereign. He addressed the following request to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>: “I
    would humbly implore your Majesty to allow the captives to accompany the heirs of that martyred leader on their return to <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, that these may, of their
    own accord, forgive them publicly their action, and enable them to recover their freedom. Such a gesture on their part will considerably enhance their
    position and will win them the esteem of their countrymen.” The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, wholly unaware of the mischievous designs of that crafty plotter, immediately
    granted his request, on the express condition that a written statement be sent to him from <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> assuring him that the condition of the prisoners after
    their freedom was entirely satisfactory, and that no harm was likely to befall them in the future.
</p>No sooner were the captives delivered into the hands of the <mark class="term unknown">mischief-makers</mark> than they set about gratifying their feelings of implacable hatred towards
    them. On the first night after they had been handed over to their enemies, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark>, the brother of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Alláh-Vardí</mark> and paternal uncle of
    <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Hádí</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Javád-i-Farhádí</mark>, a noted merchant of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> who had acquired a reputation for piety and uprightness which stood as high as that
    of his illustrious brother, was mercilessly put to death. Knowing <a name="Page_282"></a>full well that in his own native town they would be unable to
    inflict upon him the punishment they desired, they determined to take his life whilst in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> in a manner that would protect them from the suspicion of
    murder. At the hour of midnight, they perpetrated the shameful act, and, the next morning, announced that illness had been the cause of his death. His
    friends and acquaintances, mostly natives of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, none of whom had been able to detect the crime that had extinguished such a noble life, accorded him a
    burial that befitted his station.
<p></p>The rest of his companions, among whom were <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Táhir-i-<u>Sh</u>írází</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhir-i-<u>Sh</u>írázi</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ibráhím-i-Maḥallátí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ibráhím-i-Maḥallatí</mark>, both of whom were greatly esteemed for their
    learning and character, were savagely put to death immediately after their arrival at <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>. The entire population, which had been sedulously instigated
    beforehand, clamoured for their immediate execution. A band of shameless scoundrels, armed with knives, swords, spears, and axes, fell upon them and tore
    them to pieces. They mutilated their bodies with such wanton barbarity that no fragment of their scattered members could be found for burial.
<p></p>Gracious God! Acts of such incredible savagery have been perpetrated in a town like <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, which prides itself on the fact that no less than a hundred of
    the highest ecclesiastical leaders of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> dwell within its gates, and yet none could be found among all its inhabitants to raise his voice in protest
    against such revolting murders! No one seemed to question their right to perpetrate such iniquitous and shameless deeds. No one seemed to be aware of the
    utter incompatibility between such ferocious deeds committed by those who claimed to be the sole repositories of the mysteries of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, and the exemplary
    conduct of those who first manifested its light to the world. No one was moved to exclaim indignantly: “O evil and perverse generation! To what depths of
    infamy and shame you have sunk! Have not the abominations which you have wrought surpassed in their ruthlessness the acts of the basest of men? Will you
    not recognise that neither the beasts of the field nor any moving thing on earth has ever equalled the ferociousness of your acts? How long is your
    heedlessness to last? Is it not your <a name="Page_283"></a>belief that the efficacy of every congregational prayer is dependent upon the integrity of him
    who leads that prayer? Have you not again and again declared that no such prayer is acceptable in the sight of God until and unless the <mark class="term correct">imám</mark> who leads the
    congregation has purged his heart from every trace of malice? And yet you deem those who instigate and share in the performance of such atrocities to be
    the true leaders of your Faith, the very embodiments of fairness and justice. Have you not committed to their hands the reins of your Cause and regarded
    them as the masters of your destinies?”
<p></p><p>The news of this outrage reached <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and spread with bewildering rapidity throughout the city. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark> vehemently protested. “In what passage
    of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>,” he is reported to have exclaimed, “in which tradition of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, has the massacre of a number of people been justified in order to avenge
    the murder of a single person?” <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> also expressed his strong disapproval of the treacherous conduct of the <mark class="term misspelled">Sadr-i-Ardibílí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣadr-i-Ardibílí</mark> and his
    confederates. He denounced his cowardice, banished him from the capital, and condemned him to a life of obscurity in <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>. His degradation from office
    pleased immensely the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, who had hitherto laboured in vain to bring about his downfall, and whom his sudden removal from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> relieved of the
    apprehensions which the extension of his authority had inspired. His own denunciation of the massacre of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> was prompted, not so much by his sympathy
    with the Cause of the defenceless victims, as by his hope of involving the <mark class="term misspelled">Sadr-i-Ardibílí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣadr-i-Ardibílí</mark> in such embarrassments as would inevitably disgrace him in the
    eyes of his sovereign.
</p>The failure of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and of his government to inflict immediate punishment upon the malefactors encouraged them to seek further means for the
    gratification of their relentless hatred towards their opponents. They now directed their attention to <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> herself, and resolved that she should suffer
    at their hands the same fate that had befallen her companions. While still in confinement, <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>, as soon as she was informed of the designs of her
    enemies, addressed the following message to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, who had succeeded to the position of his father and was now recognised <a name="Page_284"></a>as the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>: “<mark class="term unknown">‘Fain</mark> would they put out God’s light with their mouths: but God only desireth to perfect His light, albeit the infidels
    abhor it.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn283" name="_ftnref283" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> If my Cause be the Cause of Truth, if the Lord whom I worship
    be none other than the one true God, He will, ere nine days have elapsed, deliver me from the yoke of your tyranny. Should He fail to achieve my
    deliverance, you are free to act as you desire. You will have irrevocably established the falsity of my belief.” <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, recognising his inability
    to accept so bold a challenge, chose to ignore entirely her message, and sought by every cunning device to accomplish his purpose.
<p></p>In those days, ere the hour which <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> had fixed for her deliverance had struck, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> signified His wish that she should be delivered from her
    captivity and brought to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. He determined to establish, in the eyes of the adversary, the truth of her words, and to frustrate the schemes which her
    enemies had conceived for her death. <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-Hádíy-i-Farhádí</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-Hádiy-i-Farhádí</mark> was accordingly summoned by Him and was entrusted with the task of effecting her immediate
    transference to His own home in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Hádí</mark> was charged to deliver a sealed letter to his wife, <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>átún-Ján</mark>, and instruct her to proceed,
    in the guise of a beggar, to the house where <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> was confined; to deliver the letter into her hands; to wait awhile at the entrance of her house, until
    she should join her, and then to hasten with her and commit her to his care. “As soon as <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> has joined you,” <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> urged the emissary, “start
    immediately for <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. This very night, I shall despatch to the neighbourhood of the gate of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> an attendant, with three horses, that you will take
    with you and station at a place that you will appoint outside the walls of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>. You will conduct <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> to that spot, will mount the horses, and will,
    by an unfrequented route, endeavour to reach at daybreak the outskirts of the capital. As soon as the gates are opened, you must enter the city and proceed
    immediately to My house. You should exercise the utmost caution lest her identity be disclosed. The Almighty will assuredly guide your steps and will
    surround you with His unfailing protection.” <a name="Page_285"></a>Fortified by the assurance of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Hádí</mark> set out immediately to carry out the instructions he had received. Unhampered by any obstacle, he,
    ably and faithfully, acquitted himself of his task, and was able to conduct <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> safely, at the appointed hour, to the home of his Master. Her sudden
    and mysterious removal from <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> filled her friends and foes alike with consternation. The whole night, they searched the houses and were baffled in
    their efforts to find her. The fulfilment of the prediction she had uttered astounded even the most sceptical among her opponents. A few were made to
    realise the supernatural character of the Faith she had espoused, and submitted willingly to its claims. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>, her own brother,
acknowledged, that very day, the truth of the Revelation, but failed to demonstrate subsequently by his acts the sincerity of his belief.    <a href="#_ftn284" name="_ftnref284" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><p></p>The hour which <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> had fixed for her deliverance found her already securely established under the sheltering shadow of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. She knew full well
into whose presence she had been admitted; she was profoundly aware of the sacredness of the hospitality she had been so graciously accorded.    <a href="#_ftn285" name="_ftnref285" title="">[********************************]</a> As it was with her acceptance of the Faith proclaimed by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> when
    she, unwarned and unsummoned, had hailed His Message and recognised its truth, so did she perceive through her own intuitive knowledge the future glory of
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. It was in the year <mark class="term unknown">’</mark>60, while in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, that she alluded in her odes to her recognition of the Truth He was to reveal. I have myself been
    shown in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, in the <a name="Page_286"></a>home of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, whom <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> had styled <mark class="term misspelled">Fata’l-Malih</mark><mark class="term correction">Fata’l-Malíḥ</mark>, the verses which she, in her own handwriting,
    had penned, every letter of which bore eloquent testimony to her faith in the exalted Missions of both the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. In that ode the following
    verse occurs: “The effulgence of the <mark class="term correct">Abhá</mark> Beauty hath pierced the veil of night; behold the souls of His lovers dancing, <mark class="term unknown">moth-like</mark>, in the light that has
    flashed from His face!” It was her steadfast conviction in the unconquerable power of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> that prompted her to utter her prediction with such
    confidence, and to fling her challenge so boldly in the face of her enemies. Nothing short of an immovable faith in the unfailing efficacy of that power
    could have induced her, in the darkest hours of her captivity, to assert with such courage and assurance the approach of her victory.
<p></p>A few days after <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>’s arrival at <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> decided to send her to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> in the company of the believers who were preparing to
    depart for that province. He too had determined to leave the capital and take the same direction a few days later. He accordingly summoned <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark> and
    instructed him to take immediately the necessary measures to ensure the removal of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>, together with her woman attendant, <mark class="term misspelled">Qanitih</mark><mark class="term correction">Qánitih</mark>, to a place outside
    the gate of the capital, from whence they were, later on, to proceed to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. He cautioned him to exercise the utmost care and vigilance lest
    the guards who were stationed at the entrance of the city, and who had been ordered to refuse the passage of women through the gates without a permit,
    should discover her identity and prevent her departure.
<p></p>I have heard <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark> recount the following: “Putting our trust in God, we rode out, <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>, her attendant, and I, to a place in the vicinity of the
    capital. None of the guards who were stationed at the gate of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>imírán</mark> raised the slightest objection, nor did they enquire regarding our
    destination. At a distance of two <mark class="term correct">farsangs</mark><a href="#_ftn286" name="_ftnref286" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> from the capital, we
    alighted in the midst of an orchard abundantly watered and situated at the foot of a mountain, in the centre of which was a house that seemed completely
    deserted. As I went about in search of the proprietor, I chanced to meet an old <a name="Page_287"></a>man who was watering his plants. In answer to my
    enquiry, he explained that a dispute had arisen between the owner and his tenants, as a result of which those who occupied the place had deserted it. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark>
    have been asked by the owner,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he added, <mark class="term unknown">‘to</mark> keep guard over this property until the settlement of the dispute.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I was greatly delighted with the
    information he gave me, and asked him to share with us our luncheon. When, later in the day, I decided to depart for <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, I found him willing to watch
    over and guard <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> and her attendant. As I committed them to his care, I assured him that I would either myself return that evening or send a trusted
    attendant whom I would follow the next morning with all the necessary requirements for the journey to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>.
<p></p>“Upon my arrival at <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, I despatched <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Báqir</mark>, one of the Letters of the Living, together with an attendant, to join <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>. I informed <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>
of her safe departure from the capital. He was greatly pleased at the information I gave Him, and named that orchard <mark class="term misspelled">‘Ba<u>gh</u>-i-Jannat</mark><mark class="term correction">Bá<u>gh</u>-i-Jannat</mark>.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn287" name="_ftnref287" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><mark class="term unknown">‘That</mark> house,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He remarked, <mark class="term unknown">‘has</mark> been providentially prepared for your
    reception, that you may entertain in it the loved ones of God.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“<mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> tarried seven days in that spot, after which she set out, accompanied by <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥasan-i-Qazvíní</mark>, surnamed <mark class="term misspelled">Fata</mark> <mark class="term correction">Fatá</mark>, and a few others, in the
direction of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. I was commanded by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> to arrange for her departure and to provide whatever might be required for her journey.”    <a name="Page_288"></a>CHAPTER XVI: THE CONFERENCE OF BADA<u>SH</u>T
SOON after <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> had started on her journey, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> instructed <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark> to complete the necessary preparations for His contemplated departure
    for <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. He committed to his care His family and asked him to provide whatever might be conducive to their <mark class="term unknown">well-being</mark> and safety.
</p>When He arrived at <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>áh-Rud</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>áh-Rúd</mark>, He was met by <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, who had left <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, where he had been residing, and had come to welcome Him as soon as
    he had heard of His approach. The whole province of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> was in those days in the throes of a violent agitation. The activities which <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and
    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had initiated, their zeal, their courage, their outspoken language, had aroused the people from their lethargy, had kindled in the hearts of
    some the noblest sentiments of faith and devotion, and had provoked in the breasts of others the instincts of passionate fanaticism and malice. A multitude
    of seekers constantly poured from every direction into <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, eagerly sought the residence of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and through him were ushered into the
    presence of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>.
<p></p>Their numbers soon swelled to such proportions as to excite the apprehension of the authorities. The chief constable viewed with concern and dismay the
    crowds of agitated people who streamed unceasingly into every quarter of the holy City. In his desire to assert his rights, intimidate <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and
    induce him to curtail the scope of his activities, he issued orders to arrest immediately the latter’s special attendant, whose name was <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, and subject
    him to cruel and shameful treatment. They pierced his nose, passed a cord through the incision, and with this halter led and paraded him through the
    streets.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was in the presence of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> when the news of the disgraceful affliction that had befallen his servant <a name="Page_289"></a>reached him.
    Fearing lest this sad intelligence might grieve the heart of his beloved chief, he arose and quietly retired. His companions soon gathered round him,
    expressed their indignation at this outrageous assault upon so innocent a follower of their Faith, and urged him to avenge the insult. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> tried
    to appease their anger. “Let not,” he pleaded, “the indignity that has befallen <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> afflict and disturb you, for <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> is still with you and will safely
    deliver him back into your hands <mark class="term unknown">to-morrow</mark>.”
<p></p><p>In the face of so solemn an assurance, his companions ventured no further remarks. Their hearts, however, burned with impatience to redress that bitter
    injury. A number of them eventually decided to band themselves together and loudly raise, through the streets of <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark>
    <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!”<a href="#_ftn288" name="_ftnref288" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> as a protest against this sudden affront to the
    dignity of their Faith. That cry was the first of its kind to be raised in <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> in the name of the Cause of God. The city <mark class="term unknown">re-echoed</mark> with the
    sound of those voices. The reverberations of their shouts reached even the most outlying regions of the province, raised a great tumult in the hearts of
    the people, and were the signal for the tremendous happenings that were destined to transpire in the future.
</p>In the midst of the confusion that ensued, those who were holding the halter with which they dragged <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> through the streets, perished by the sword. The
    companions of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> conducted the released captive into the presence of their leader and informed him of the fate that had befallen the oppressor.
    “You have refused,” <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> is reported to have remarked, “to tolerate the trials to which <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> has been subjected; how can you reconcile yourselves
    to the martyrdom of <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>?”<a href="#_ftn289" name="_ftnref289" title="">[*********************************]</a>The city of <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, which had just recovered its peace and tranquillity after the rebellion that the <mark class="term misspelled">Salar</mark><mark class="term correction">Sálár</mark> had provoked, was plunged again into
confusion and distress. Prince <mark class="term correct">Ḥamzih</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> was stationed with his men and munitions at a distance of four <mark class="term correct">farsangs</mark><a href="#_ftn290" name="_ftnref290" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> from the city, ready to face whatever emergency might arise when the
    news of these fresh disturbances suddenly reached him. He immediately <a name="Page_290"></a>despatched a detachment to the city with instructions to
    obtain the assistance of the governor for the arrest of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and to conduct him into his presence. <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Mara<u>gh</u>iyí</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Mará<u>gh</u>iyí</mark>,
    the captain of the prince’s artillery, immediately intervened. “I deem myself,” he pleaded, “one among the lovers and admirers of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. If you
    contemplate inflicting any harm upon him, I pray you to take my life and then to proceed to execute your design; for I cannot, so long as I live, tolerate
    the least disrespect towards him.”
<p></p><p>The prince, who knew full well how much he stood in need of that officer, was greatly embarrassed at this unexpected declaration. “I too have met <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>,” was his reply as he tried to remove the apprehension of <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. “I too cherish the utmost devotion to him. By summoning him to
    my camp, I am hoping to restrict the scope of the mischief which has been kindled and to safeguard his person.” The prince then addressed in his own
    handwriting a letter to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> in which he urged the extreme desirability of his transferring his residence for a few days to his headquarters, and
    assured him of his sincere desire to shield him from the attacks of his infuriated opponents. He gave orders that his own highly ornamented tent be pitched
    in the vicinity of his camp and be reserved for the reception of his expected guest.
</p>On the receipt of this communication, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> presented it to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, who advised him to respond to the invitation of the prince. “No harm can befall
    you,” <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> assured him. “As to me, I shall this very night set out in the company of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alíy-i-Qazvíní</mark>, one of the Letters of the Living,
for <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>. Please God, you too, later on, at the head of a large company of the faithful and preceded by the <mark class="term unknown">‘Black</mark> Standards,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> will depart from Ma    <u>sh</u>had and join me. We shall meet at whatever place the Almighty will have decreed.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> joyously responded. He threw himself at the feet of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and assured him of his firm determination to discharge with fidelity the
obligations which he had imposed upon him. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> lovingly took him in his arms and, kissing his eyes and his forehead, committed him to the    <a name="Page_291"></a>Almighty’s unfailing protection. Early that same afternoon, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> mounted his steed and rode out with dignity and calm to the
    encampment of Prince <mark class="term correct">Ḥamzih</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, and was ceremoniously conducted by <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who, together with a number of officers, had been appointed
    by the prince to go out and welcome him, to the tent that had been specially erected for his use.
</p>That very night, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> summoned to his presence <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir-i-Qá’iní</mark>, who had built the <mark class="term correct">Bábíyyih</mark>, together with a number of the most prominent
    among his companions, and enjoined upon them to bear unquestioned allegiance to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and to obey implicitly whatever he might wish them to do.
    “Tempestuous are the storms which lie ahead of us,” he told them. “The days of stress and violent commotion are fast approaching. Cleave to him, for in
    obedience to his command lies your salvation.”
<p></p><p>With these words, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> bade farewell to his companions and, accompanied by <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alíy-i-Qazvíní</mark>, departed from <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>. A few days
    later, he encountered <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán-i-Núrí</mark>, who informed him of the circumstances attending the deliverance of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> from her confinement in <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, of
    her journey in the direction of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, and of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s subsequent departure from the capital. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark>, as well as <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>, <a name="Page_292"></a>remained in the company of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> until their arrival at <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark>. They reached that hamlet at the hour of dawn
    and found there assembled a large gathering of people whom they recognised as their <mark class="term unknown">fellow-believers</mark>. They decided, however, to resume their journey, and
    proceeded directly to <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>áh-Rud</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>áh-Rúd</mark>. As they were approaching that village, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark>, who was following at a distance behind them, encountered
    <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-i-Haná-Sab</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-i-Ḥaná-Sáb</mark>, who was on his way to <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark>. In answer to his enquiry as to the object of that gathering, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark> was informed that
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> had, a few days before, left <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>áh-Rud</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>áh-Rúd</mark> for that hamlet; that a large number of believers had already arrived from <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>,
    <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, and other towns of Persia, and were waiting to accompany <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> on His intended journey to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. “Tell <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aḥmad-i-Ibdal</mark> <mark class="term correction">Aḥmad-i-Ibdál</mark>, who is
now in <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark>,” <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark> remarked, “that this very morning a light has shone upon you, the radiance of which you have failed to recognise.”    <a href="#_ftn291" name="_ftnref291" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a>
</p>No sooner had <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> been informed by <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-i-Haná-Sab</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-i-Ḥaná-Sáb</mark> of the arrival of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> at <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>áh-Rud</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>áh-Rúd</mark> than He decided to join him. Attended by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-i-Mu’allim-i-Núrí</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-i-Mu‘allim-i-Núrí</mark>, He set out on horseback that same evening for that village, and had returned with <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark> the next morning at
    the hour of sunrise.
<p></p>It was then the beginning of summer. Upon His arrival, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> rented three gardens, one of which He assigned exclusively to the use of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, another
    He set apart for <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> and her attendant, and reserved the third for Himself. <a name="Page_293"></a>Those who had gathered in <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark> were
    <mark class="term unknown">eighty-one</mark> in number, all of whom, from the time of their arrival to the day of their dispersion, were the guests of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. Every day, He revealed a
    Tablet which <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Sulaymán-i-Núrí</mark> chanted in the presence of the assembled believers. Upon each He bestowed a new name. He Himself was henceforth
    designated by the name of <mark class="term correct">Bahá</mark>; upon the Last Letter of the Living was conferred the appellation of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, and to <mark class="term correct">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark> was given the title of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>. To each of those who had convened at <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark> a special Tablet was subsequently revealed by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, each of whom He addressed by the name
    recently conferred upon him. When, at a later time, a number of the more rigid and conservative among her <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> chose to accuse <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> of
    indiscreetly rejecting the <mark class="term unknown">time-honoured</mark> traditions of the past, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, to whom these complaints had been addressed, replied in the following terms:
    “What am I to say regarding her whom the Tongue of Power of Glory has named <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> [the Pure One]?”
<p></p><p>Each day of that memorable gathering witnessed the abrogation of a new law and the repudiation of a <mark class="term unknown">long-established</mark> tradition. The veils that guarded the
    sanctity of the ordinances of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> were sternly rent asunder, and the idols that had so long claimed the adoration of their blind worshippers were rudely
    demolished. No one knew, however, the Source whence these bold and defiant innovations proceeded, no one suspected the Hand which steadily and unerringly
    steered their course. Even the identity of Him who had bestowed a new name upon each of those who had congregated in that hamlet remained unknown to those
    who had received them. Each conjectured according to his own degree of understanding. Few, if any, dimly surmised that <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was the Author of the
    <mark class="term unknown">far-reaching</mark> changes which were being so fearlessly introduced.
</p><u>Sh</u>
    ay<u>kh</u><mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark>, one of the <mark class="term unknown">best-informed</mark> as to the nature of the developments in <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark>, is reported to have related the following incident:
    “Illness, one day, confined <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> to His bed. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, as soon as he heard of His indisposition, hastened to visit Him. He seated himself, when
    ushered into His presence, on the right hand of <a name="Page_294"></a><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. The rest of the companions were gradually admitted to His presence, and
    grouped themselves around Him. No sooner had they assembled than <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥasan-i-Qazvíní</mark>, the messenger of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>, upon whom the name of <mark class="term correct">Fata’l-Qazvíní</mark>
    had been newly conferred, suddenly came in and conveyed to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> a pressing invitation from <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> to visit her in her own garden. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> have severed myself
entirely from her,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he boldly and decisively replied. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> refuse to meet her.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn292" name="_ftnref292" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> The messenger retired immediately, and soon returned, reiterating the
    same message and appealing to him to heed her urgent call. <mark class="term unknown">‘She</mark> insists on your visit,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> were his words. <mark class="term unknown">‘If</mark> you persist in your refusal, she herself will
    come to you.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Perceiving his unyielding attitude, the messenger unsheathed his sword, laid it at the feet of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, and said: <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> refuse to go without you.
    Either choose to accompany me to the presence of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> or cut off my head with this sword.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> have already declared my intention not to visit <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> angrily retorted. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> am willing to comply with the alternative which you have chosen to put before me.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“<mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥasan</mark>, who had seated himself at the feet of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, had stretched forth his neck to receive the fatal blow, when suddenly the figure of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>,
adorned and unveiled, appeared before the eyes of the assembled companions. Consternation immediately seized the entire gathering.<a href="#_ftn293" name="_ftnref293" title="">[**********************************]</a> All stood aghast before this sudden and most unexpected    <a name="Page_295"></a>apparition. To behold her face unveiled was to them inconceivable. Even to gaze at her shadow was a thing which they deemed
improper, inasmuch as they regarded her as the very incarnation of <mark class="term misspelled">Fátimih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Fáṭimih</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn294" name="_ftnref294" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> the noblest emblem of chastity in their eyes.
</p>“Quietly, silently, and with the utmost dignity, <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> stepped forward and, advancing towards <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, seated herself on his <mark class="term unknown">right-hand</mark> side. Her
    unruffled serenity sharply contrasted with the affrighted countenances of those who were gazing upon her face. Fear, anger, and bewilderment stirred the
    depths of their souls. That sudden revelation seemed to have stunned their faculties. <mark class="term misspelled">‘Abdu’l-<u>Kh</u>áliq-i-Iṣfáhání</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abdu’l-<u>Kh</u>aliq-i-Iṣfáhání</mark> was so gravely shaken that he cut
    his throat with his own hands. Covered with blood and shrieking with excitement, he fled away from the face of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>. A few, following his example,
    abandoned their companions and forsook their Faith. A number were seen standing speechless before her, confounded with wonder. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, meanwhile, had
    remained seated in his place, holding the unsheathed sword in his hand, his face betraying a feeling of inexpressible anger. It seemed as if he were
    waiting for the moment when he could strike his fatal blow at <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>.
<p></p>“His threatening attitude failed, however, to move her. Her countenance displayed that same dignity and confidence which she had evinced at the first
    moment of her appearance before the assembled believers. A feeling of joy and triumph had now illumined her face. She rose from her seat and, undeterred by
    the tumult that she had raised in the hearts of her companions, began to address the remnant of that assembly. Without the least premeditation, and in
    language which bore a striking resemblance to that of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, she delivered her appeal with matchless eloquence and profound fervour. She concluded her
    address with this verse of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>: <mark class="term unknown">‘Verily</mark>, amid gardens and rivers shall the pious dwell in the seat of truth, in the presence of the potent King.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> As
    she uttered these words, she cast a furtive glance towards both <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> in such a manner that those who were watching her were unable to
    tell to which of the two she was alluding. Immediately <a name="Page_296"></a>after, she declared: <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> am the Word which the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> is to utter, the Word
    which shall put to flight the chiefs and nobles of the earth!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn295" name="_ftnref295" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><p></p>“She then turned her face towards <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and rebuked him for having failed to perform in <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> those things which she deemed essential to the
    welfare of the Faith. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> am free to follow the promptings of my own conscience,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> retorted <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> am not subject to the will and pleasure of my
    <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Turning away her eyes from him, <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> invited those who were present to celebrate befittingly this great occasion. <mark class="term unknown">‘This</mark> day is the
    day of festivity and universal rejoicing,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> she added, <mark class="term unknown">‘the</mark> day on which the fetters of the past are burst asunder. Let those who have shared in this great
    achievement arise and embrace each other.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p>That memorable day and those which immediately followed it witnessed the most revolutionary changes in the life and habits of the assembled followers of
    the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. Their manner of worship underwent a sudden and fundamental transformation. The prayers and ceremonials by which those devout worshippers had been
    disciplined were irrevocably <a name="Page_297"></a>discarded. A great confusion, however, prevailed among those who had so zealously arisen to advocate
    these reforms. A few condemned so radical a change as being the essence of heresy, and refused to annul what they regarded as the inviolable precepts of
    <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. Some regarded <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> as the sole judge in such matters and the only person qualified to claim implicit obedience from the faithful. Others who
    denounced her behaviour held to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, whom they regarded as the sole representative of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, the only one who had the right to pronounce upon such
    weighty matters. Still others who recognised the authority of both <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> viewed the whole episode as a <mark class="term unknown">God-sent</mark> test designed to separate the
    true from the false and distinguish the faithful from the disloyal.
</p><mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> herself ventured on a few occasions to repudiate the authority of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>. “I deem him,” she is reported to have declared, “a pupil whom the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> has
    sent me to edify and instruct. I regard him in no other light.” <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> did not fail, on his part, to denounce <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> as “the author of heresy,” and
    stigmatised those who advocated her views as “the victims of error.” This state of tension persisted for a few days until <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> intervened and, in
    His masterly manner, effected a complete reconciliation between them. He healed the wounds which that sharp controversy had caused, and directed the
    efforts of both along the path of constructive service.<a href="#_ftn296" name="_ftnref296" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><p></p>The object of that memorable gathering had been attained.<a href="#_ftn297" name="_ftnref297" title="">[***********************************]</a> The
    <mark class="term unknown">clarion-call</mark> of the new Order had been sounded. <a name="Page_298"></a>The obsolete conventions which had fettered the consciences of men were boldly
    challenged and fearlessly swept away. The way was clear for the proclamation of the laws and precepts that were destined to usher in the new Dispensation.
    The remnant of the companions who had gathered in <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark> accordingly decided to depart for <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> seated themselves in the
    same howdah<a href="#_ftn298" name="_ftnref298" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> which had been prepared for their journey by
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. On their way, <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> each day composed an ode which she instructed those who accompanied her to chant as they followed her howdah. Mountain
    and valley <mark class="term unknown">re-echoed</mark> the shouts with which that enthusiastic band, as they journeyed to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, hailed the extinction of the old, and the birth of the
    new Day.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s sojourn in <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark> lasted two and twenty days. In the course of their journey to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, a few of the followers of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> sought
    to abuse the liberty which the repudiation of the laws and sanctions of an outgrown Faith had conferred upon them. They viewed the unprecedented action of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> in discarding the veil as a signal to transgress the bounds of moderation and to gratify their selfish desires. The excesses in which a few
    indulged provoked the wrath of the Almighty and caused their immediate dispersion. In the village of <mark class="term correct">Níyálá</mark>, they were grievously tested and suffered
    severe injuries at the hands of their enemies. This scattering extinguished the mischief which a few of the irresponsible among the adherents of the Faith
    had sought to kindle, and preserved untarnished its honour and dignity.
<p></p>I have heard <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> Himself describe that incident: <a name="Page_299"></a>“We were all gathered in the village of <mark class="term correct">Níyálá</mark> and were resting at the foot
    of a mountain, when, at the hour of dawn, we were suddenly awakened by the stones which the people of the neighbourhood were hurling upon us from the top
    of the mountain. The fierceness of their attack induced our companions to flee in terror and consternation. I clothed <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> in my own garments and
    despatched him to a place of safety, where I intended to join him. When I arrived, I found that he had gone. None of our companions had remained in <mark class="term correct">Níyálá</mark>
    except <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> and a young man from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’lláh</mark>. The violence with which we were assailed had brought desolation into our camp. I found
    no one into whose custody I could deliver <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> except that young man, who displayed on that occasion a courage and determination that were truly
    surprising. Sword in hand, undaunted by the savage assault of the inhabitants of the village, who had rushed to plunder our property, he sprang forward to
    stay the hand of the assailants. Though himself wounded in several parts of his body, he risked his life to protect our property. I bade him desist from
    his act. When the tumult had subsided, I approached a number of the inhabitants of the village and was able to convince them of the cruelty and
    shamefulness of their behaviour. I subsequently succeeded in restoring a part of our plundered property.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, accompanied by <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> and her attendant, proceeded to <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>. He appointed <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark> to watch over her and ensure her
    protection and safety. Meanwhile the <mark class="term unknown">mischief-makers</mark> were endeavouring to kindle the anger of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> against <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, and, by
    representing Him as the prime mover of the disturbances of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>áh-Rud</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>áh-Rúd</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, succeeded eventually in inducing the sovereign to have Him
    arrested. “I have hitherto,” the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> is reported to have angrily remarked, “refused to countenance whatever has been said against him. My
    indulgence has been actuated by my recognition of the services rendered to my country by his father. This time, however, I am determined to put him to
    death.”
</p><p>He accordingly commanded one of his officers in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> to instruct his son who was residing in <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> to arrest <a name="Page_300"></a><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and
    to conduct Him to the capital. The son of this officer received the communication on the very day preceding the reception which he had prepared to offer to
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, to whom he was devotedly attached. He was greatly distressed and did not divulge the news to anyone. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, however, perceived his
    sadness and advised him to put his trust in God. The next day, as He was being accompanied by His friend to his home, they encountered a horseman who was
    coming from the direction of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. “<mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> is dead!” that friend exclaimed in the <mark class="term unknown">Mázindarání</mark> dialect, as he hastened to rejoin Him after a
    brief conversation with the messenger. He drew out the imperial summons and showed it to Him. The document had lost its efficacy. That night was spent in
    the company of his guest in an atmosphere of undisturbed calm and gladness.
</p><mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> had in the meantime fallen into the hands of his opponents, and was confined in <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark><mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark> in the home of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>, the leading <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> of
    that town. The rest of his companions, after their dispersal in <mark class="term correct">Níyálá</mark>, had scattered in different directions, each carrying with him to his
    <mark class="term unknown">fellow-believers</mark> the news of the momentous happenings of <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark>. <a name="Page_301"></a>CHAPTER XVII: THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>’S INCARCERATION IN THE CASTLE OF <mark class="term unknown"><u>CH</u>IHRÍQ</mark>THE incident of <mark class="term correct">Níyálá</mark> occurred in the middle of the month of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>a’bán</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>a‘bán</mark>, in the year 1264 A.H.    <a href="#_ftn299" name="_ftnref299" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> Towards the end of that same month, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was brought to <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>,
    where He suffered at the hands of His oppressors a severe and humiliating injury. That deliberate affront to His dignity almost synchronised with the
    attack which the inhabitants of <mark class="term correct">Níyálá</mark> directed against <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and His companions. The one was pelted with stones by an ignorant and pugnacious
    people; the other was afflicted with stripes by a cruel and treacherous enemy.
<p></p>I shall now relate the circumstances that led to that odious indignity which the persecutors of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> chose to inflict upon Him. He had, in pursuance of
the orders issued by <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, been transferred to the castle of <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark><a href="#_ftn300" name="_ftnref300" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> and consigned to the keeping of <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Kurd</mark>, whose
    sister was the wife of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, the mother of the <mark class="term misspelled">Nayibu’s-Saltanih</mark><mark class="term correction">Náyibu’s-Salṭanih</mark>. Strict and explicit instructions <a name="Page_302"></a>had been given by
    the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, enjoining him not to allow anyone to enter the presence of his Prisoner. He was particularly warned not to follow the
example of <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Máh-Kú’í</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>an-i-Máh-Kú’í</mark>, who had gradually been led to disregard the orders he had received.    <a href="#_ftn301" name="_ftnref301" title="">[************************************]</a>Despite the emphatic character of that injunction, and in the face of the unyielding opposition of the <mark class="term unknown">all-powerful</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>
    found himself powerless to abide by those instructions. He, too, soon came to feel the fascination of his Prisoner; he, too, forgot, as soon as he came
    into contact with His spirit, the duty he was expected to perform. At the very outset, the love of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> penetrated his heart and claimed his entire
    being. The Kurds who lived in <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, and whose fanaticism and hatred of the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ahs</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ahs</mark> exceeded the aversion which the inhabitants of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>
    entertained for that people, were likewise subjected to the transforming influence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. Such was the love He had kindled in their hearts that every
    morning, ere they started for their daily work, they directed their steps towards His prison and, gazing from afar at the castle which contained His
    beloved self, invoked His name and besought His blessings. They would prostrate themselves on the ground and seek to refresh their souls with remembrance
    of Him. To one another they would freely relate the wonders of His power and glory, and would recount such dreams as bore witness to the creative power of
His influence. To no one would <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> refuse admittance to the castle.    <a href="#_ftn302" name="_ftnref302" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> As <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark> itself was unable to accommodate the increasing
    number of visitors who flocked to its gates, they were enabled to obtain the necessary lodgings in <mark class="term misspelled">Iski-<u>Sh</u>ahr</mark><mark class="term correction">Iskí-<u>Sh</u>ahr</mark>, the old <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, which was
    situated at an hour’s distance from the <a name="Page_303"></a>castle. Whatever provisions were required for the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> were purchased in the old town and
    transported to His prison.
<p></p>One day the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> asked that some honey be purchased for Him. The price at which it had been bought seemed to Him exorbitant. He refused it and said: “Honey
    of a superior quality could no doubt have been purchased at a lower price. I who am your example have been a merchant by profession. It behoves you in all
    your transactions to follow in My way. You must neither defraud your neighbour nor allow him to defraud you. Such was the way of your Master. The shrewdest
    and ablest of men were unable to deceive Him, nor did He on His part choose to act ungenerously towards the meanest and most helpless of creatures.” He
    insisted that the attendant who had made that purchase should return and bring back to Him a honey superior in quality and cheaper in price.
<p></p>During the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s captivity in the castle of <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, events of a startling character caused grave perturbation to the government. It soon became
    evident that a number of the most eminent among the siyyids, the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark>, and the government officials of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>úy</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>uy</mark> had espoused the Cause of the
    Prisoner and had completely identified themselves with His Faith. Among them figured <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark> and his brother <mark class="term misspelled">Buyuk-Áqá</mark><mark class="term correction">Búyúk-Áqá</mark>, both siyyids of
    distinguished merit who had risen with fevered earnestness to proclaim their Faith to all sorts and conditions of people among their countrymen. A
    continuous stream of seekers and confirmed believers flowed back and forth, as the result of such activities, between <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>úy</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>uy</mark> and <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>.
<p></p>It came to pass at that time that a prominent official of high literary ability, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark>, who was later surnamed <mark class="term correct">Dayyán</mark> by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and whose
    vehement denunciations of His Message had baffled those who had endeavoured to convert him, dreamed a dream. When he awoke, he determined not to recount it
    to anyone, and, fixing his choice on two verses of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, he addressed the following request to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>: “I have conceived three definite things in my
    mind. I request you to reveal to me their nature.” <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark> was asked to submit this written request to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. A few days later, he received a
    reply <a name="Page_304"></a>penned in the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s handwriting, in which He set forth in their entirety the circumstances of that dream and revealed a the
    exact texts of those verses. The accuracy of that reply brought about a sudden conversion. Though unused to walking, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark> hastened on foot
    along that steep and stony path which led from <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>úy</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>uy</mark> to the castle. His friends tried to induce him to proceed on horseback to <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, but he
    refused their offer. His meeting with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> confirmed him in his belief and excited that fiery ardour which he continued to manifest to the end of his
    life.
<p></p>That same year the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had expressed His desire that forty of His companions should each undertake to compose a treatise and seek, by the aid of verses and
    traditions, to establish the validity of His Mission. His wishes were instantly obeyed, and the result of their labours was duly submitted to His presence.
    <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark>’s treatise won the unqualified admiration of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and ranked highest in His estimation. He bestowed on him the name <mark class="term correct">Dayyán</mark> and revealed
    in his honour the <mark class="term misspelled">Lawḥ-i-Hurúfat</mark><mark class="term correction">Lawḥ-i-Ḥurúfát</mark><a href="#_ftn303" name="_ftnref303" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> in which He made the following
    statement: “Had the Point of the <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark><a href="#_ftn304" name="_ftnref304" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> no other testimony with
    which to establish His truth, this were sufficient—that He revealed a Tablet such as this, a Tablet such as no amount of learning could produce.”
<p></p><p>The people of the <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark>, who utterly misconceived the purpose underlying that Tablet, thought it to be a mere exposition of the science of <mark class="term correct">Jafr</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn305" name="_ftnref305" title="">[*************************************]</a> When, at a later time, in the early years of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s
    incarceration in the prison city of <mark class="term misspelled">Akká</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Akká</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Jináb-i-Muballi<u>gh</u></mark> made, from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, his request that He unravel the mysteries of that Tablet,
    there was revealed from His pen an explanation which they who misconceived the words of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> might do well to ponder. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> adduced from the
statements of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> irrefutable evidence proving that the appearance of the <mark class="term unknown">Man-Yu<u>zh</u>iruhu’llah</mark>    <a href="#_ftn306" name="_ftnref306" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> must needs occur no less than nineteen years after the
Declaration of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. The mystery of the <mark class="term correct">Musta<u>gh</u>á<u>th</u></mark>    <a href="#_ftn307" name="_ftnref307" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> had long baffled the most searching minds among the people of the
    <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark> and had proved an unsurmountable <a name="Page_305"></a>obstacle to their recognition of the promised One. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had Himself in that Tablet
    unravelled that mystery; no one, however, was able to understand the explanation which He had given. It was left to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> to unveil it to the eyes of
    all men.
</p>The untiring zeal which <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark> displayed induced his father, who was an intimate friend of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, to report to him the circumstances
    which led to the conversion of his son, and to inform him of his negligence in carrying out the duties which the State had imposed upon him. He expatiated
    upon the eagerness with which so able a servant of the government had risen to serve his new Master, and the success which had attended his efforts.
<p></p>A further cause for apprehension on the part of the government authorities was supplied by the arrival at <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark> of a dervish who had come from
    India and who, as soon as he met the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, acknowledged the truth of His Mission. All who met that dervish, whom the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had named <mark class="term misspelled">Qahru’llah</mark><mark class="term correction">Qahru’lláh</mark>, during his
    sojourn at <mark class="term misspelled">Iski-<u>Sh</u>ahr</mark><mark class="term correction">Iskí-<u>Sh</u>ahr</mark>, felt the warmth of his enthusiasm and were deeply impressed by the tenacity of his conviction. An increasing number of people
    became enamoured of the charm of his personality and willingly acknowledged the compelling power of his Faith. Such was the influence which he exercised
    over them that a few among the believers were inclined to regard him as an exponent of Divine Revelation, although he altogether disclaimed such
    pretensions. He was often heard to relate the following: “In the days when I occupied the exalted position of a <mark class="term unknown">navváb</mark> in India, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> appeared to me in
    a vision. He gazed at me and won my heart completely. I arose, and had started to follow Him, when He looked at me intently and said: <mark class="term unknown">‘Divest</mark> yourself of
    your gorgeous attire, depart from your native land, and hasten on foot to meet Me in <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>. In <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark> you will attain your heart’s
    desire.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I followed His directions and have now reached my goal.”
<p></p><p>The news of the turmoil which that lowly dervish had been able to raise among the Kurdish leaders in <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark> reached <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> and was thence
    communicated to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. No sooner had the news reached the capital than orders <a name="Page_306"></a>were issued to transfer the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> immediately to <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>
in the hope of allaying the excitement which His continued residence in that locality had provoked. Before the news of this fresh order had reached    <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had charged <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark> to inform <mark class="term misspelled">Qahru’llah</mark> <mark class="term correction">Qahru’lláh</mark> of His desire that he return to India and there consecrate his life to the service of His
    Cause. “Alone and on foot,” He commanded him, “he should return whence he came. With the same ardour and detachment with which he performed his pilgrimage
    to this country, he must now repair to his native land and unceasingly labour to advance the interests of the Cause.” He also bade him instruct <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb-i-Tur<u>sh</u>ízí</mark>, who was living in <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>úy</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>uy</mark>, to proceed immediately to <mark class="term correct">Urúmíyyih</mark>, where He said He would soon join him. <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark> himself
    was directed to leave for <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> and there inform <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ibráhím-i-<u>Kh</u>alíl</mark> of His approaching arrival at that city. “Tell him,” the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> added, “that
    the fire of Nimrod will shortly be kindled in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, but despite the intensity of its flame no harm will befall our friends.”
</p><p>No sooner had <mark class="term misspelled">Qahru’llah</mark> <mark class="term correction">Qahru’lláh</mark> received the message from his Master than he arose to carry out His wishes. To anyone who wished to accompany him, he would say:
    “You can never endure the trials of this journey. Abandon the thought of coming with me. You would surely perish on your way, inasmuch as the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> has
    commanded me to return alone to my native land.” The compelling force of his reply silenced those who begged to be allowed to journey with him. He refused
    to accept either money or clothing from anyone. Alone, clad in the meanest attire, staff in hand, he walked all the way back to his country. No one knows
    what ultimately befell him.
</p><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alíy-i-Zunúzí</mark>, surnamed <mark class="term correct">Anís</mark>, was among those who heard of the message from the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, and was fired with the desire to hasten to    <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark> and attain His presence. Those words had kindled in him an irrepressible longing to sacrifice himself in His path. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alíy-i-Zunúzí</mark>,
    his stepfather, a notable of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, strenuously objected to his leaving the city, and was at last induced to confine him in his house and strictly watch
    over him. His <a name="Page_307"></a>Son languished in his confinement until the time when his Beloved had reached <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> and had been taken back again to
    His prison in <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>.
<p></p>I have heard <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Zunúzí</mark> relate the following: “At about the same time that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> dismissed <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark> from His presence, I was
    instructed by Him to collect all the available Tablets that He had revealed during His incarceration in the castles of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark> and <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, and to
    deliver them into the hands of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ibráhím-i-<u>Kh</u>alíl</mark>, who was then living in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, and urge him to conceal and preserve them with the utmost
    care.
<p></p>“During my stay in that city, I often visited <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alíy-i-Zunúzí</mark>, who was related to me, and frequently heard him deplore the sad fate of his son. <mark class="term unknown">‘He</mark>
    seems to have lost his reason,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he bitterly complained. <mark class="term unknown">‘He</mark> has, by his behaviour, brought reproach and shame upon me. Try to calm the agitation of his
    heart and induce him to conceal his convictions.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Every day I visited him, I witnessed the tears that continually rained from his eyes. After the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had
    departed from <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, one day as I went to see him, I was surprised to note the joy and gladness which had illumined his countenance. His handsome face was
    wreathed in smiles as he stepped forward to receive me. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> eyes of my Beloved,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he said, as he embraced me, <mark class="term unknown">‘have</mark> beheld this face, and these eyes have
    gazed upon His countenance.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘Let</mark> me,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he added, <mark class="term unknown">‘tell</mark> you the secret of my happiness. After the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had been taken back to <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, one day, as I
    lay confined in my cell, I turned my heart to Him and besought Him in these words: “Thou beholdest, O my <mark class="term unknown">Best-Beloved</mark>, my captivity and helplessness, and
    knowest how eagerly I yearn to look upon Thy face. Dispel the gloom that oppresses my heart, with the light of Thy countenance.” What tears of agonising
    pain I shed that hour! I was so overcome with emotion that I seemed to have lost consciousness. Suddenly I heard the voice of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and, lo! He was
    calling me. He bade me arise. I beheld the majesty of His countenance as He appeared before me. He smiled as He looked into my eyes. I rushed forward and
flung myself at His feet. “Rejoice,” He said; “the hour is approaching when, in this very city, I shall be suspended before the eyes of the multitude    <a name="Page_308"></a>and shall fall a victim to the fire of the enemy. I shall choose no one except you to share with Me the cup of martyrdom. Rest
    assured that this promise which I give you shall be fulfilled.” I was entranced by the beauty of that vision. When I recovered, I found myself immersed in
    an ocean of joy, a joy the radiance of which all the sorrows of the world could never obscure. That voice keeps ringing in my ears. That vision haunts me
    both in the daytime and in the <mark class="term unknown">night-season</mark>. The memory of that ineffable smile has dissipated the loneliness of my confinement. I am firmly convinced that
    the hour at which His pledge is to be fulfilled can no longer be delayed.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I exhorted him to be patient and to conceal his emotions. He promised me not to
    divulge that secret, and undertook to exercise the utmost forbearance towards <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>. I hastened to assure the father of his determination, and
    succeeded in obtaining his release from his confinement. That youth continued until the day of his martyrdom to associate, in a state of complete serenity
    and joy, with his parents and kinsmen. Such was his behaviour towards his friends and relatives that, on the day he laid down his life for his Beloved, the
    people of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> all wept and bewailed him.” <a name="Page_309"></a>CHAPTER XVIII: EXAMINATION OF THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark> AT <mark class="term misspelled">TABRIZ</mark><mark class="term correction">TABRÍZ</mark>THE <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, in anticipation of the approaching hour of His affliction, had dispersed His disciples who had gathered in <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark> and awaited with calm
resignation the order which was to summon Him to <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>. Those into whose custody He was delivered thought it inadvisable to pass through the town of    <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>úy</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>uy</mark>, which lay on their route to the capital of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>. They decided to go by way of <mark class="term correct">Urúmíyyih</mark> and thus avoid the demonstrations which
    the excited populace in <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>úy</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>uy</mark> were likely to make as a protest against the tyranny of the government. When the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> arrived at <mark class="term correct">Urúmíyyih</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Malik</mark><mark class="term correct">Qásim</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> ceremoniously received Him and accorded Him the warmest hospitality. In His presence, the prince acted with extraordinary deference and refused to
    allow the least disrespect on the part of those who were allowed to meet Him.
<p></p>On a certain Friday when the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was going to the public bath, the prince, who was curious to test the courage and power of his Guest, ordered his groom to
    offer Him one of his wildest horses to ride. Apprehensive lest the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> might suffer any harm, the attendant secretly approached Him and tried to induce Him
    to refuse to mount a horse that had already overthrown the bravest and most skilful of horsemen. “Fear not,” was His reply. “Do as you have been bidden,
    and commit Us to the care of the Almighty.” The inhabitants of <mark class="term correct">Urúmíyyih</mark>, who had been informed of the intention of the prince, had filled the public
    square, eager to witness what might befall the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. As soon as the horse was brought to Him, He quietly approached it and, taking hold of the bridle which
    the groom had offered Him, gently caressed it and placed His foot in the stirrup. The horse stood still and motionless beside Him as if conscious of the
    power which was dominating it. The multitude that watched this most unusual spectacle marvelled at the <a name="Page_310"></a>Illustration: THE HOUSE OCCUPIED BY THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark> IN <mark class="term correct">URÚMÍYYIH</mark>. THE <mark class="term unknown">BÁLÁ-<u>KH</u>ÁNIH</mark> (UPPER ROOM) MARKED X IS THE ROOM IN WHICH HE STAYED]    <a name="Page_311"></a>behaviour of the animal. To their simple minds this extraordinary incident appeared little short of a miracle. They hastened in
    their enthusiasm to kiss the stirrups of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, but were prevented by the attendants of the prince, who feared lest so great an onrush of people might
    harm Him. The prince himself, who had accompanied his Guest on foot as far as the vicinity of the bath, was bidden by Him, ere they reached its entrance,
    to return to his residence. All the way, the prince’s footmen were endeavouring to restrain the people who, from every side, were pressing forward to catch
    a glimpse of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. Upon His arrival, He dismissed all those who had accompanied Him except the prince’s private attendant and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, who waited
    in the antechamber and aided Him in undressing. On His return from the bath, He again mounted the same horse and was acclaimed by the same multitude. The
    prince came on foot to meet Him, and escorted Him back to his residence.
<p></p>No sooner had the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> left the bath than the people of <mark class="term correct">Urúmíyyih</mark> rushed to take away, to the last drop, the water which had served for His ablutions. Great
    excitement prevailed on that day. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, as He observed these evidences of unrestrained enthusiasm, was reminded of the <mark class="term unknown">well-known</mark> tradition, commonly
    ascribed to the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, the Commander of the Faithful, which specifically referred to <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>. The lake of <mark class="term correct">Urúmíyyih</mark>, that same tradition
    asserts in its concluding passages, will boil up, will overrun its banks, and inundate the town. When He was subsequently informed how the overwhelming
    majority of the people had spontaneously arisen to proclaim their undivided allegiance to His Cause, He calmly observed: “Think men that when they say, <mark class="term unknown">‘We</mark>
    believe,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> they shall be let alone and not be put to the proof?”<a href="#_ftn308" name="_ftnref308" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a>
    This comment was fully justified by the attitude which that same people assumed towards Him when the news of the dreadful treatment meted out to Him in
    <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> reached them. Hardly a handful among those who had so ostentatiously professed their faith in Him persevered, in the hour of trial, in their
allegiance to His Cause. Foremost among these was <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Imám-Vardí</mark>, the tenacity of whose faith no one except <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Jalíl-i-Urúmí</mark>, a native of    <a name="Page_312"></a><mark class="term correct">Urúmíyyih</mark> and one of the Letters of the Living, could surpass. Adversity served but to intensify the ardour of his devotion and to
    reinforce his belief in the righteousness of the Cause he had embraced. He subsequently attained the presence of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, the truth of whose Mission he
    readily recognised, and for the advancement of which he strove with the same fevered earnestness that had characterised his earlier strivings for the
    promotion of the Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. In recognition of his <mark class="term unknown">long-standing</mark> services, he, and also his family, were honoured with numerous Tablets from the pen
    of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in which He extolled his achievements and invoked the blessings of the Almighty upon his efforts. With unflinching determination, he
    continued to labour for the furtherance of the Faith until past eighty years of age, when he departed this life.
<p></p>The tales of the signs and wonders which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s unnumbered admirers had witnessed were soon transmitted from mouth to mouth, and gave rise to a wave of
    unprecedented enthusiasm which spread with bewildering rapidity over the entire country. It swept over <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and roused the ecclesiastical dignitaries of
    the realm to fresh exertions against Him. They trembled at the progress of a Movement which, if allowed to run its course, they felt certain would soon
    engulf the institutions upon which their authority, nay their very existence, depended. They saw on every side increasing evidences of a faith and devotion
    such as they themselves had been powerless to evoke, of a loyalty which struck at the very root of the fabric which their own hands had reared and which
    all the resources at their command had as yet failed to undermine.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, in particular, was in the throes of the wildcat excitement. The news of the impending arrival of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had inflamed the imagination of its
    inhabitants and had kindled the fiercest animosity in the hearts of the ecclesiastical leaders of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>. These alone, of all the people of
    <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, abstained from sharing in the demonstrations with which a grateful population hailed the return of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to their city. Such was the fervour of
popular enthusiasm which that news had evoked that the authorities decided to house the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in a place outside the gates of the city. Only those    <a name="Page_313"></a>whom He desired to meet were allowed the privilege of approaching Him. All others were strictly refused admittance.
<p></p>On the second night after His arrival, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> summoned <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark> to His presence and, in the course of His conversation with him, asserted emphatically His
    claim to be none other than the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>. He found him, however, reluctant to acknowledge this claim unreservedly. Perceiving his inner agitation, He
    said: “<mark class="term unknown">To-morrow</mark> I shall, in the presence of the <mark class="term correct">Valí-‘Ahd</mark>,<a href="#_ftn309" name="_ftnref309" title="">[**************************************]</a> and
    in the midst of the assembled <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> and notables of the city, proclaim My Mission. Whoso may feel inclined to require from Me any other testimony besides
    the verses which I have revealed, let him seek satisfaction from the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> of his idle fancy.”
<p></p><p>I have heard <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark> testify to the following: “That night I was in a state of great perturbation. I remained awake and restless until the hour of sunrise. As
    soon as I had offered my morning prayer, however, I realised that a great change had come over me. A new door seemed to have been unlocked and set open
    before my face. The conviction soon dawned upon me that if I were loyal to my faith in <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, the Apostle of God, I must needs also unreservedly
    acknowledge the claims advanced by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and must submit without fear or hesitation to whatever He might choose to decree. This conclusion allayed the
    agitation of my heart. I hastened to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and begged His forgiveness. <mark class="term unknown">‘It</mark> is a further evidence of the greatness of this Cause,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He remarked, <mark class="term unknown">‘that</mark> even
    <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark><a href="#_ftn310" name="_ftnref310" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> should have felt so exceedingly troubled and shaken by its
    power and the immensity of its claim.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> <mark class="term unknown">‘Rest</mark> assured,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He added, <mark class="term unknown">‘the</mark> grace of the Almighty shall enable you to fortify the faint in heart and to make firm
    the step of the waverer. So great shall be your faith that should the enemy mutilate and tear your body to pieces, in the hope of lessening by one jot or
    tittle the ardour of your love, he would fail to attain his object. You will, no doubt, in the days to come, meet face to face Him who is the Lord of all
    the worlds, and will partake of the joy of His presence.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> These words dispelled the gloom of my apprehensions. From that day onward, no trace of either
    fear or agitation ever again cast its shadow upon me.” <a name="Page_314"></a>The detention of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> outside the gate of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> failed to allay the excitement which reigned in the city. Every measure of precaution, every
    restriction, which the authorities had imposed, served only to aggravate a situation which had already become ominous and menacing. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark> issued
    his orders for the immediate convocation of the ecclesiastical dignitaries of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> in the official residence of the governor of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark> <mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark> for
    the express purpose of arraigning the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and of seeking the most effective means for the extinction of His influence. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Maḥmúd</mark>, entitled the
<mark class="term misspelled">Nizámu’l-’Ulama’</mark> <mark class="term correction">Niẓámu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>, who was the tutor of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> the <mark class="term correct">Valí-‘Ahd</mark>,<a href="#_ftn311" name="_ftnref311" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-i-Mamaqání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-i-Mámáqání</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Aṣ<u>gh</u>ar</mark> the    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>u’l-Islám</mark>, and a number of the most distinguished <mark class="term correct"><u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ís</mark> and doctors of divinity were among those who had convened for
that purpose.<a href="#_ftn312" name="_ftnref312" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> himself attended that    <a name="Page_315"></a>gathering. The presidency belonged to the <mark class="term misspelled">Nizámu’l-’Ulama’</mark> <mark class="term correction">Niẓámu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>, who, as soon as the proceedings had begun, in the name of the assembly
    commissioned an officer of the army to introduce the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> into their presence. A multitude of people had meanwhile besieged the entrance of the hall and
    were impatiently awaiting the time when they could catch a glimpse of His face. They were pressing forward in such large numbers that a passage had to be
    forced for Him through the crowd that had collected before the gate.
</p>Upon His arrival, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> observed that every seat in that hall was occupied except one which had been reserved for the <mark class="term correct">Valí-‘Ahd</mark>. He greeted the assembly
    and, without the slightest hesitation, proceeded to occupy that vacant seat. The majesty of His gait, the expression of overpowering confidence which sat
    upon His brow—above all, the spirit of power which shone from His whole being, appeared to have for a moment crushed the soul out of the body of those whom
    He had greeted. A deep, a mysterious silence, suddenly fell upon them. Not one soul in that distinguished assembly dared breathe a single word. At last the
    stillness which brooded over them was broken by the <mark class="term misspelled">Nizámu’l-’Ulama’</mark><mark class="term correction">Niẓámu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>. “Whom do you claim to be,” he asked the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, “and what is the message which you have
brought?” “I am,” thrice exclaimed the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, “I am, I am, the promised One! I am the One whose name you have for a thousand years invoked, at whose    <a name="Page_316"></a>mention you have risen, whose advent you have longed to witness, and the hour of whose Revelation you have prayed God to hasten.
    Verily I say, it is incumbent upon the peoples of both the East and the West to obey My word and to pledge allegiance to My person.” No one ventured to
    reply except <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-i-Mamaqání</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-i-Mámáqání</mark>, a leader of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í</mark> community who had been himself a disciple of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. It was he on whose
    unfaithfulness and insincerity the siyyid had tearfully remarked, and the perversity of whose nature he had deplored. <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Zunúzí</mark>,
    who had heard <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> make these criticisms, recounted to me the following: “I was greatly surprised at the tone of his reference to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>,
    and was curious to know what his future behaviour would be so as to merit such expressions of pity and condemnation from his master. Not until I discovered
    his attitude that day towards the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> did I realise the extent of his arrogance and blindness. I was standing together with other people outside the hall,
    and was able to follow the conversation of those who were within. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> was seated on the left hand of the <mark class="term correct">Valí-‘Ahd</mark>. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was occupying a seat
    between them. Immediately after He had declared Himself to be the promised One, a feeling of awe seized those who were present. They had dropped their
    heads in silent confusion. The pallor of their faces betrayed the agitation of their hearts. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, that <mark class="term unknown">one-eyed</mark> and <mark class="term unknown">white-bearded</mark> renegade,
    insolently reprimanded Him, saying: <mark class="term unknown">‘You</mark> wretched and immature lad of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>! You have already convulsed and <a name="Page_317"></a>subverted <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>;

I have been
    summoned to this place.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘Hold</mark> your peace,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> furiously retorted <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, <mark class="term unknown">‘you</mark> perverse and contemptible follower of Satan!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘Your</mark> Honour,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>
    again answered, <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> maintain what I have already declared.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“The <mark class="term misspelled">Nizámu’l-’Ulama’</mark> <mark class="term correction">Niẓámu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> uthought it best to challenge His Mission openly. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> claim which you have advanced,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he told the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, <mark class="term unknown">‘is</mark> a stupendous one; it must

He Himself testifies to this truth: “Is it not enough for them that We have sent down to Thee the Book?”    <a href="#_ftn313" name="_ftnref313" title="">[***************************************]</a> The power to produce such evidence has been given to Me by God.
    Within the space of two days and two nights, I declare Myself able to reveal verses of such number as will equal the whole of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> <mark class="term unknown">‘Describe</mark>

    sooner had He uttered the words, <mark class="term unknown">‘In</mark> the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate, praise be to Him who has <a name="Page_318"></a>created the heaven
    and the earth,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> than <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-i-Mamaqání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-i-Mámáqání</mark> interrupted and called His attention to all infraction of the rules of grammar. <mark class="term unknown">‘This</mark> <mark class="term unknown">self-appointed</mark> <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>
    of ours,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he cried in haughty scorn, <mark class="term unknown">‘has</mark> at the very start of his address betrayed his ignorance of the most rudimentary rules of grammar!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>

    limitations <a name="Page_319"></a>of His creatures. Nay, the rules and canons which men have adopted have been deduced from the text of the Word of God
    and are based upon it. These men have, in the very texts of that holy Book, discovered no less than three hundred instances of grammatical error, such as
the one you now criticise. Inasmuch as it was the Word of God, they had no other alternative except to resign themselves to His will.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>    <a href="#_ftn314" name="_ftnref314" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a>
</p>“He then repeated the <mark class="term unknown">same-words</mark> He had uttered, to which <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> raised again the same objection. Shortly after, another person ventured to put
    this question to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>: <mark class="term unknown">‘To</mark> which tense does the word I<u>sh</u>tartanna belong?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> In answer to him, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> quoted this verse of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>: <mark class="term unknown">‘Far</mark> be the
    glory of thy Lord, the Lord of all greatness, from what they impute to Him, and peace be upon His Apostles! And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
    Immediately after, He arose and left the gathering.”<a href="#_ftn315" name="_ftnref315" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><p></p>The <mark class="term misspelled">Nizámu’l-’Ulama’</mark><mark class="term correction">Niẓámu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> was sorely displeased at the manner in which the meeting had been conducted. “How shameful,” he was heard to exclaim later, “is the
    discourtesy of the people of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>! What could possibly be the connection between these idle remarks and the consideration of such weighty, such momentous
    issues?” A few others were likewise <a name="Page_320"></a>inclined to denounce the disgraceful treatment meted out to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> on that occasion. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-i-Mamaqání</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-i-Mámáqání</mark>, however, persisted in his vehement denunciations. “I warn you,” he loudly protested, “if you allow this youth to pursue unhampered the
    course of his activities, the day will come when the entire population of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> will have flocked to his standard. Should he, when that day arrives,
    signify his wish that all the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, that the <mark class="term correct">Valí-‘Ahd</mark> himself, should be expelled from the city and that he should alone assume the reins of
    civil and ecclesiastical authority, no one of you, who now view with apathy his cause, will feel able to oppose him effectually. The entire city, nay the
    whole province of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>, will on that day unanimously support him.”
<p></p><p>The persistent denunciations of that evil plotter excited the apprehensions of the authorities of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>. Those who held the reins of power in their grasp
    took counsel together as to the most effective measures to be taken to resist the progress of His Faith. Some urged that in view of the marked disrespect
    which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had shown to the <mark class="term correct">Valí-‘Ahd</mark> in occupying his seat without his leave, and because of His failure to obtain the consent of the chairman of that
    gathering when He arose to depart, He should be summoned again to a like gathering and should receive from the hands of its members a humiliating
    punishment. <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, however, refused to entertain this proposal. Finally it was decided that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> should be brought to the home of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Aṣ<u>gh</u>ar</mark>, who was both the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>u’l-Islám</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> and a siyyid, and should receive at the hands of the governor’s bodyguard the
    chastisement which He deserved. The guard refused to accede to this request, preferring not to interfere in a matter which they regarded as the sole
    concern of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of the city. The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>u’l-Islám</mark> himself decided to inflict the punishment. He summoned the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to his home, and with
his hand eleven times applied the rods to His feet.<a href="#_ftn316" name="_ftnref316" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a>    <a name="Page_321"></a>That same year this insolent tyrant was struck with paralysis, and, after enduring the most excruciating pain, died a miserable death. His treacherous,
    avaricious, and <mark class="term unknown">self-seeking</mark> character was universally recognised by the people of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>. Notoriously cruel and sordid, he was feared and despised by the
    people who groaned under his yoke and prayed for deliverance. The abject circumstances of his death reminded both his friends and his opponents of the
    punishment which must necessarily await those whom neither the fear of God nor the voice of conscience can deter from behaving with such perfidious cruelty
    towards their fellow men. After his death the functions of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>u’l-Islám</mark> were abolished in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>. Such was his infamy that the very
    name of the institution with which he had been associated came to be abhorred by the people.
</p>And yet his behaviour, base and treacherous as it was, was only one instance of the villainous conduct which characterised the attitude of the
    ecclesiastical leaders among his countrymen towards the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. How far and how grievously have these erred from the path of fairness and justice! How
    contemptuously have they cast away the counsels of the Prophet of God and the admonitions of the <mark class="term correct">imáms</mark> of the Faith! Have not these explicitly declared
that “should a <a name="Page_322"></a>Youth from <mark class="term correct">Baní-Há<u>sh</u>im</mark><a href="#_ftn317" name="_ftnref317" title="">[****************************************]</a> be made manifest and summon the people to a new Book and to
    new laws, all should hasten to Him and embrace His Cause”? Although these same <mark class="term correct">imáms</mark> have clearly stated that “most of His enemies shall be the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark>,”
    yet these blind and ignoble people have chosen to follow the example of their leaders and to regard their conduct as the pattern of righteousness and
    justice. They walk in their footsteps, implicitly obey their orders, and deem themselves the “people of salvation,” the “chosen of God,” and the
    “custodians of His Truth.”
<p></p><p>From <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was taken back to <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, where He was again entrusted to the keeping of <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. His persecutors had fondly imagined
    that by summoning Him to their presence they would, through threats and intimidation, induce Him to abandon His Mission. That gathering enabled the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to
    set forth emphatically, in the presence of the most illustrious dignitaries assembled in the capital of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark> <mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>, the distinguishing features of
    His claim, and to confute, in brief and convincing language, the arguments of His adversaries. The news of that momentous declaration, fraught with such
    <mark class="term unknown">far-reaching</mark> consequences, spread rapidly throughout Persia and stirred again more deeply the feelings of the disciples of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. It reanimated their
    zeal, reinforced their position, and was a signal for the tremendous happenings that were soon to convulse that land. <a name="Page_323"></a>No sooner had the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> returned to <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark> than He wrote in bold and moving language a denunciation of the character and action of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>.
In the opening passages of that epistle, which was given the name of the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>utbiy-i-Qahríyyih</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>uṭbiy-i-Qahríyyih</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn318" name="_ftnref318" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> the Author addresses the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>
    in these terms: “O thou who hast disbelieved in God and hast turned thy face away from His signs!” That lengthy epistle was forwarded to <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, who, in
    those days, was confined in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. He was instructed to deliver it in person to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>.

    arrived. He recounted the circumstances attending the delivery of the Tablet, and recited before us the entire text, which was about three pages in length,
    and which he had committed to memory.” The tone of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s reference to <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> indicated how greatly pleased He was with the purity and nobleness of
    his life, and how much He admired his undaunted courage, his indomitable will, his unworldliness, and his unwavering constancy. <a name="Page_324"></a>CHAPTER XIX: THE <mark class="term correct">MÁZINDARÁN</mark> UPHEAVALIN THE same month of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>a’bán</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>a‘bán</mark> that witnessed the indignities inflicted upon the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, and the afflictions which befell <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and His
    companions in <mark class="term correct">Níyálá</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> returned from the camp of Prince <mark class="term correct">Ḥamzih</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, from which place he was to proceed seven days later to
    <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> accompanied by whomsoever he might desire. The prince offered him a sum to defray the expenses of his journey, an offer that he declined, sending
    the money back with a message requesting him to expend it for the relief of the poor and needy. <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> likewise volunteered to provide
    all the requirements of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>’s intended pilgrimage, and expressed his eagerness to pay also the expenses of whomsoever he might choose to accompany
    him. All that he accepted from him was a sword and a horse, both of which he was destined to utilise with consummate bravery and skill in repulsing the
    assaults of a treacherous enemy.
<p></p>My pen can never adequately describe the devotion which <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had kindled in the hearts of the people of <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, nor can it seek to fathom
    the extent of his influence. His house, in those days, was continually besieged by crowds of eager people who begged to be allowed to accompany him on his
    contemplated journey. Mothers brought their sons, and sisters their brothers, and tearfully implored him to accept them as their most cherished offerings
    on the Altar of Sacrifice.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was still in <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark> when a messenger arrived bearing to him the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s turban and conveying the news that a new name, that of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, had been conferred upon him by his Master. “Adorn your head,” was the message, “with My green turban, the emblem of My lineage, and, with the Black
    Standard<a href="#_ftn319" name="_ftnref319" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> unfurled before you, <a name="Page_325"></a>hasten to

    beloved <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>.”
<p></p><p>As soon as that message reached him, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> arose to execute the wishes of his Master. Leaving <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark> for a place situated at a <mark class="term correct">farsang</mark>’s    <a href="#_ftn321" name="_ftnref321" title="">[*]</a> distance from the city, he hoisted the Black Standard, placed the turban of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> upon his head,
    assembled his companions, mounted his steed, and gave the signal for their march to the <mark class="term misspelled">Jazíriy-i-<u>Kh</u>adrá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Jazíriy-i-<u>Kh</u>aḍra</mark>. His companions, who were two hundred and
two in number, enthusiastically followed him. That memorable day was the nineteenth of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>a’bán</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>a‘bán</mark>, in the year 1264 A.H.    <a href="#_ftn322" name="_ftnref322" title="">[†]</a> Wherever they tarried, at every village and hamlet through which they passed, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and his
    <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> would fearlessly proclaim the message of the New Day, would invite the people to embrace its truth, and would select from among those who
    responded to their call a few whom they would ask to join them on their journey.
</p>In the town of <mark class="term misspelled">Ni<u>sh</u>ápúr</mark><mark class="term correction">Ní<u>sh</u>apúr</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Majíd</mark>, the father of <mark class="term misspelled">Badí</mark><mark class="term correction">Badí‘</mark>,<a href="#_ftn323" name="_ftnref323" title="">[‡]</a> who was a merchant of note,
    enlisted under the banner of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. Though his father enjoyed an unrivalled prestige as the owner of the <mark class="term unknown">best-known</mark> turquoise mine of Ni<u>sh</u><mark class="term unknown">ápúr</mark>, he, forsaking all the honours and material benefits that his native town had conferred upon him, pledged his undivided loyalty to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. In
    the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Miyamay</mark><mark class="term correction">Míyámay</mark>, thirty among its inhabitants declared their faith <a name="Page_326"></a>and joined that company. All of them with the exception of
    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Isa</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Ísá</mark>, fell martyrs in the fort of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>.<a href="#_ftn324" name="_ftnref324" title="">[§]</a><p></p>Arriving at <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>a<u>sh</u>mih-‘Alí</mark>, a place situated near the town of <mark class="term unknown">Dám<u>gh</u>án</mark> and on the highroad to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> decided to break
    his journey and to tarry there for a few days. He encamped under the shadow of a big tree, by the side of a running stream. “We stand at the parting of the
ways,” he told his companions. “We shall await His decree as to which direction we should take.” Towards the end of the month of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>avval</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>avvál</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn325" name="_ftnref325" title="">[**]</a> a fierce gale arose and struck down a large branch of that tree; whereupon <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> observed:
    “The tree of the sovereignty of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> has, by the will of God, been uprooted and hurled to the ground.” On the third day after he had
uttered that prediction, a messenger, who was on his way to <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, arrived from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and reported the death of his sovereign.    <a href="#_ftn326" name="_ftnref326" title="">[††]</a> The following day, the company determined to leave for <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>. As their leader arose to depart,
    he pointed in the direction of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> and said: “This is the way that leads to our <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. Whoever is unprepared for the great trials that lie before
    us, let him now repair to his home and give up the journey.” He several times repeated that warning, and, as he approached <mark class="term correct">Savád-Kúh</mark>, explicitly declared:
    “I, together with <mark class="term unknown">seventy-two</mark> of my companions, shall suffer death for the sake of the <mark class="term unknown">Well-Beloved</mark>. Whoso is unable to renounce the world, let him now at
    this very moment, depart, for later on he will be unable to escape.” Twenty of his companions chose to return, feeling themselves powerless to withstand
    the trials to which their chief continually alluded. <a name="Page_327"></a>Illustrations: VIEW OF THE VILLAGE OF <mark class="term misspelled">MIYAMAY</mark><mark class="term correction">MÍYÁMAY</mark>; EXTERIOR OF THE <mark class="term correct">MASJID</mark>; INTERIOR OF THE <mark class="term correct">MASJID</mark>, WHERE <mark class="term misspelled">MULLA</mark><mark class="term correction">MULLÁ</mark><mark class="term correct">ḤUSAYN</mark> AND HIS COMPANIONS PRAYED]    <a name="Page_328"></a>The news of their approach to the town of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> alarmed the <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>. The widespread and growing popularity of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, the
    circumstances attending his departure from <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, the Black Standard which waved before him—above all, the number, the discipline, and the
    enthusiasm of his companions, combined to arouse the implacable hatred of that cruel and overbearing <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark>. He bade the crier summon the people of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> to the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> and announce that a sermon of such momentous consequence was to be delivered by him that no loyal adherent of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> in that
    neighbourhood could afford to ignore it. An immense crowd of men and women thronged the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>, saw him ascend the pulpit, fling his turban to the ground,
    tear open the neck of his shirt, and bewail the plight into which the Faith had fallen. “Awake,” he thundered from the pulpit, for our enemies stand at our
    very doors, ready to wipe out all that we cherish as pure and holy in <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>! Should we fail to resist them, none will be left to survive their onslaught.
    He who is the leader of that band came alone, one day, and attended my classes. He utterly ignored me and treated me with marked disdain in the presence of
    my assembled disciples. As I refused to accord him the honours which he expected, he angrily arose and flung me his challenge. This man had the temerity,
    at a time when <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> was seated upon his throne and was at the height of his power, to assail me with so much bitterness. What excesses this
    <mark class="term unknown">stirrer-up</mark> of mischief, who is now advancing at the head of his savage band, will not commit now that the protecting hand of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> has been
    suddenly withdrawn! It is the duty of all the inhabitants of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>, both young and old, both men and women, to arm themselves against these
    contemptible wreckers of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, and by every means in their power to resist their onset. <mark class="term unknown">To-morrow</mark>, at the hour of dawn, let all of you arise and march out
    to exterminate their forces.”
<p></p><p>The entire congregation arose in response to his call. His passionate eloquence, the undisputed authority he exercised over them, and the dread of the loss
    of their own lives and property, combined to induce the inhabitants of that town to make every possible preparation for the coming <a name="Page_329"></a>encounter. They armed themselves with every weapon which they could either find or devise, and set out at break of day from the town of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark> <mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>,
    fully determined to face and slay the enemies of their Faith and to plunder their property.<a href="#_ftn327" name="_ftnref327" title="">[‡‡]</a>
</p>As soon as <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had determined to pursue the way that led to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, he, immediately after he had offered his morning prayer, bade his
    companions discard all their possessions. “Leave behind all your belongings,” he urged them, “and content yourselves only with your steeds and swords, that
    all may witness your renunciation of all earthly things, and may realise that this little band of God’s chosen companions has no desire to safeguard its
    own property, much less to covet the property of others.” Instantly they all obeyed and, unburdening their steeds, arose and joyously followed him. The
    father of <mark class="term misspelled">Badí</mark><mark class="term correction">Badí‘</mark> was the first to throw aside his satchel, which contained a considerable amount of turquoise which he had brought with him from the mine
    that belonged to his father. One word from <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> proved sufficient to induce him to fling by the <mark class="term unknown">road-side</mark> what was undoubtedly his most treasured
    possession, and to cling to the desire of his leader.
<p></p>At a <mark class="term correct">farsang</mark>’s<a href="#_ftn328" name="_ftnref328" title="">[§§]</a> distance from <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and his companions encountered their
    enemies. A multitude of people, fully equipped with arms and ammunition, had gathered, and blocked their way. A fierce expression of savagery rested upon
    their countenances, and the foulest <a name="Page_330"></a>imprecations fell unceasingly from their lips. The companions, in the face of the uproar of this
    angry populace, made as if to unsheathe their swords. “Not yet,” commanded their leader; “not until the aggressor forces us to protect ourselves must our
    swords leave their scabbards.” He had scarcely uttered these words when the fire of the enemy was directed against them. Six of the companions were
    immediately hurled to the ground. “Beloved leader,” exclaimed one of them, “we have risen and followed you with no desire except to sacrifice ourselves in
    the path of the Cause we have embraced. Allow us, we pray you, to defend ourselves, and suffer us not to fall so disgracefully a victim to the fire of the
    enemy.” “The time is not yet come,” replied <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>; “the number is as yet incomplete.” A bullet immediately after pierced the breast of one of his
    companions, a siyyid from <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark><a href="#_ftn329" name="_ftnref329" title="">[***]</a> who had walked all the way from <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark> to that place, and who
    ranked among his staunchest supporters. At the sight of that devoted companion fallen dead at his feet, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> raised his eyes to heaven and prayed:
    “Behold, O God, my God, the plight of Thy chosen companions, and witness the welcome which these people have accorded Thy loved ones. Thou knowest that we
    cherish no other desire than to guide them to the way of Truth and to confer upon them the knowledge of Thy Revelation. Thou hast Thyself commanded us to
    defend our lives against the assaults of the enemy. Faithful to Thy command, I now arise with my companions to resist the attack which they have launched
    against us.”<a href="#_ftn330" name="_ftnref330" title="">[†††]</a><p></p>Unsheathing his sword and spurring on his charger into the midst of the enemy, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> pursued, with marvellous intrepidity, the assailant of his
    fallen companion. His opponent, who was afraid to face him, took refuge behind a tree and, holding aloft his musket, sought to shield himself. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
    immediately recognised him, rushed <a name="Page_331"></a>forward, and with a single stroke of his sword cut across the trunk of the tree, the barrel of
    the musket, and the body of his adversary.<a href="#_ftn331" name="_ftnref331" title="">[‡‡‡]</a> The astounding force of that stroke confounded the enemy
    and paralysed their efforts. All fled <mark class="term unknown">panic-stricken</mark> in the face of so extraordinary a manifestation of skill, of strength, and of courage. This feat was
    the first of its kind to attest to the prowess and heroism of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, a feat which earned him the commendation of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> likewise paid his
    tribute to the cool fearlessness which <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> displayed on that occasion. He is reported to have.quoted, when informed of the news, the following
    verse of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>: “So it was not ye who slew them, but God who slew them; and those shafts were God’s, not thine! He would make trial of the faithful by
    a gracious trial from Himself: verily, God heareth, knoweth. This befell, that God might also bring to naught the craft of the infidels.”
<p></p><p>I myself, when in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, in the year 1265 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn332" name="_ftnref332" title="">[§§§]</a> a month after the conclusion of the memorable
    struggle of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, heard <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> relate the circumstances of this incident in the presence of a number of believers, among whom
    were <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-Ḥusayn-i-Hakamiy-i-Kirmání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-Ḥusayn-i-Ḥakamíy-i-Kirmání</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl-i-Faráhání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl-i-Faráhání</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Habíbu’lláh-i-Iṣfáhání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥabíbu’lláh-i-Iṣfáhání</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-Iṣfáhání</mark>.
</p>When, at a later time, I visited <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> and was staying at the home of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq-i-<u>Kh</u>urásání</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, where I had been invited
    to teach the Cause, I asked <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-Furú<u>gh</u>í</mark>, <a name="Page_332"></a>in the presence of a number of believers, among whom were <mark class="term correct">Nabíl-i-Akbar</mark>
    and the father of <mark class="term misspelled">Badí</mark><mark class="term correction">Badí‘</mark>, to enlighten me regarding the true character of that amazing report. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> emphatically declared: “I myself was a witness
    to this act of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. Had I not seen it with my own eyes, I never would have believed it.” In this connection, the same <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> related to us
    the following story: “After the engagement of <mark class="term misspelled">Vas-Kas</mark><mark class="term correction">Vás-Kas</mark>, when Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> was completely routed, and had fled barefooted from the face of the
    companions of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark><a href="#_ftn333" name="_ftnref333" title="">[****]</a> severely rebuked him. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> have charged you,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he wrote him,
    <mark class="term unknown">‘with</mark> the mission of subduing a handful of young and contemptible students. I have placed at your disposal the army of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, and yet you have
    allowed it to suffer such a disgraceful defeat. What would have befallen you, I wonder, had I entrusted you with the mission of defeating the combined
    forces of the Russian and Ottoman governments?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The prince thought it best to entrust a messenger with the fragments of the barrel of that same rifle which
    was cleft in twain by the sword of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and to instruct him to present them, in person, to the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>. <mark class="term unknown">‘Such</mark> is,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> was his message to the <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark>,
    <mark class="term unknown">‘the</mark> contemptible strength of an adversary who, with a single stroke of his sword, has shattered into six pieces the tree, the musket, and its holder.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“So convincing a testimony of the strength of his opponent constituted, in the eyes of the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark> <mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, a challenge <a name="Page_333"></a>which no man of
    his position and authority could afford to ignore. He resolved to curb the power which, by so daring an act, had sought to assert itself against his
    forces. Unable, in spite of the overwhelming number of his men, to defeat <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and his companions fairly and honourably, he meanly resorted to
    treachery and fraud as instruments for the attainment of his purpose. He ordered the prince to affix his seal to the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> and pledge the honour of his
    officers that they would henceforth abstain from any act of hostility towards the occupants of the fort. By this means he was able to induce them to lay
    down their arms, and to inflict upon his defenceless opponents a crushing and inglorious defeat.”
</p><p>Such a remarkable display of dexterity and strength could not fail to attract the attention of a considerable number of observers whose minds had remained,
    as yet, untainted by prejudice or malice. It evoked the enthusiasm of poets who, in different cities of Persia, were moved to celebrate the exploits of the
    author of so daring an act. Their poems helped to diffuse the knowledge, and to immortalise the memory, of that mighty deed. Among those who paid their
    tribute to the valour of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was a certain <mark class="term correct">Riḍá-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Lálih-Bá<u>sh</u>í</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>an-i-Lalih-Bá<u>sh</u>í</mark>, who, in the “<mark class="term misspelled">Tarí<u>kh</u>-i-Náṣirí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Tárí<u>kh</u>-i-Náṣirí</mark>,” lavished his praise
    on the prodigious strength and the unrivalled skill which had characterised that stroke.
</p>I ventured to ask <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-Furú<u>gh</u>í</mark> whether he was aware that in the “<mark class="term misspelled">Nasi<u>kh</u>u’t-Tavari<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Nási<u>kh</u>u’t-Tavárí<u>kh</u></mark>“ mention had been made of the fact
    that <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had, in his early youth, been instructed in the art of swordsmanship, that he had acquired his proficiency only after a considerable
    period of training. “This is sheer fabrication,” affirmed <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>. “I have known him from his childhood, and have been associated with him, as a
    classmate and friend, for a long time. I have never known him to be possessed of such strength and power. I even deem myself superior in vigour and bodily
    endurance. His hand trembled as he wrote, and he often expressed his inability to write as fully and as frequently as he wished. He was greatly handicapped
    in this respect, and he continued to suffer from its effects until his journey to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>. The moment he unsheathed <a name="Page_334"></a>his sword,
    however, to repulse that savage attack, a mysterious power seemed to have suddenly transformed him. In all subsequent encounters, he was seen to be the
    first to spring forward and spur on his charger into the camp of the aggressor. Unaided, he would face and fight the combined forces of his opponents and
    would himself achieve the victory. We, who followed him in the rear, had to content ourselves with those who had already been disabled and were weakened by
    the blows they had sustained. His name alone was sufficient to strike terror into the hearts of his adversaries. They fled at mention of him; they trembled
    at his approach. Even those who were his constant companions were mute with wonder before him. We were stunned by the display of his stupendous force, his
    indomitable will and complete intrepidity. We were all convinced that he had ceased to be the <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> whom we had known, and that in him resided a
    spirit which God alone could bestow.”
<p></p><p>This same <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-Furú<u>gh</u>í</mark> related to me the following: “<mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had no sooner dealt his memorable blow to his adversary than he
    disappeared from our sight. We knew not whither he had gone. His attendant, <mark class="term correct">Qambar-‘Alí</mark>, alone could follow him. He subsequently informed us that his
    master threw himself headlong upon his enemies, and was able with a single stroke of his sword to strike down each of those who dared assail him. Unmindful
    of the bullets that rained upon him, he forced his way through the ranks of the enemy and headed for <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark> <mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>. He rode straight to the residence of
    the <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>, thrice made the circuit of his house, and cried out: <mark class="term unknown">‘Let</mark> that contemptible <a name="Page_335"></a>Illustrations: VIEWS OF THE CARAVANSERAI OF <mark class="term correct">SABZIH-MAYDÁN</mark> IN <mark class="term correct">MÁZINDARÁN</mark>] <a name="Page_336"></a>coward, who has incited the inhabitants of this town to
    wage holy warfare against us and has ignominiously concealed himself behind the walls of his house, emerge from his inglorious retreat. Let him, by his
    example, demonstrate the sincerity of his appeal and the righteousness of his cause. Has he forgotten that he who preaches a holy war must needs himself
    march at the head of his followers, and by his own deeds kindle their devotion and sustain their enthusiasm?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
</p><p>The voice of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> drowned the clamour of the multitude. The inhabitants of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark> <mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> surrendered and soon raised the cry, “Peace, peace!” No
    sooner had the voice of surrender been raised than the acclamations of the followers of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who at that moment were seen galloping towards
    <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark> <mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>, were heard from every side. The cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!”<a href="#_ftn334" name="_ftnref334" title="">[††††]</a> which they shouted at
    the top of their voices, struck dismay into the hearts of those who heard it. The companions of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who had abandoned the hope of again finding
    him alive, were greatly surprised when they saw him seated erect upon his horse, unhurt and unaffected by the fierceness of that onset. Each reverently
    approached him and kissed his stirrups.
</p>On the afternoon of that day, the peace which the inhabitants of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> had implored was granted. To the crowd which had gathered about him,
    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> spoke these words: “O followers of the Prophet of God, and <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ahs</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ahs</mark> of the <mark class="term correct">imáms</mark> of His Faith! Why have you risen against us? Why deem
    the shedding of our blood an act meritorious in the sight of God? Did we ever repudiate the truth of your Faith? Is this the hospitality which the Apostle
    of God has enjoined His followers to accord to both the faithful and the infidel? What have we done to merit such condemnation on your part? Consider: I
    alone, with no other weapon than my sword, have been able to face the rain of bullets which the inhabitants of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> have poured upon me, and
    have emerged unscathed from the midst of the fire with which you have besieged me. Both my person and my horse have escaped unhurt from your overwhelming
    attack. Except for the slight scratch which I received on my face, you have <a name="Page_337"></a>been powerless to wound me. God has protected me and
    willed to establish in your eyes the ascendancy of His Faith.”
<p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> proceeded to the caravanserai of <mark class="term correct">Sabzih-Maydán</mark>. He dismounted and, standing at the entrance of the inn, awaited the
    arrival of his companions. As soon as they had gathered and been accommodated in that place, he sent for bread and water. Those who had been commissioned
    to fetch them returned <mark class="term unknown">empty-handed</mark>, and informed him that they had been unable to procure either bread from the baker or water from the public square.
    “You have exhorted us,” they told him, “to put our trust in God and to resign ourselves to His will. <mark class="term unknown">‘Nothing</mark> can befall us but what God hath destined for
    us. Our liege Lord is He; and on God let the faithful trust!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”<a href="#_ftn335" name="_ftnref335" title="">[‡‡‡‡]</a>
</p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> ordered that the gates of the caravanserai be closed. Assembling his companions, he begged them to remain gathered in his presence until the
    hour of sunset. As the evening approached, he asked whether any among them would be willing to arise and, renouncing his life for the sake of his Faith,
    ascend to the roof of the caravanserai and sound the <mark class="term correct">a<u>dh</u>án</mark>.<a href="#_ftn336" name="_ftnref336" title="">[§§§§]</a> A youth gladly responded. No
    sooner had the opening words of “<mark class="term correct">Alláh-u-Akbar</mark>” dropped from his lips than a bullet suddenly struck him and immediately caused his death. “Let another one
    among you arise,” <a name="Page_338"></a><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> urged them, “and, with the selfsame renunciation, proceed with the prayer which that youth was unable
    to finish.” Another youth started to his feet, and had no sooner uttered the words, “I bear witness that <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> is the Apostle of God,” than he also was
    struck down by another bullet from the enemy. A third youth, at the bidding of his chief, attempted to complete the prayer which his martyred companions
    had been forced to leave unfinished. He, too, suffered the same fate. As he was approaching the end of his prayer, and was uttering the words, “There is no
    God but God,” he, in his turn, fell dead.
<p></p>The fall of his third companion decided <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> to throw open the gate of the caravanserai, and to arise, together with his friends, to repulse this
    unexpected attack from a treacherous enemy. Leaping on horseback, he gave the signal to charge upon the assailants who had massed before the gates and had
    filled the <mark class="term correct">Sabzih-Maydán</mark>. Sword in hand, and followed by his companions, he succeeded in decimating the forces that had been arrayed against him. Those few
    who had escaped their swords fled before them in panic, again pleading for peace, again imploring mercy. With the approach of evening, the entire crowd had
    vanished. The <mark class="term correct">Sabzih-Maydán</mark>, which a few hours before overflowed with a seething mass of opponents, was now deserted. The clamour of the multitude was
    stilled. Bestrewn with the bodies of the slain, the <mark class="term correct">Maydán</mark> and its surroundings offered a sad and moving spectacle, a scene which bore witness to the
    victory of God over His enemies.
<p></p>So startling a victory<a href="#_ftn337" name="_ftnref337" title="">[*****]</a> induced a number of the nobles and chiefs of the people to intervene and
    beseech the mercy of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> on behalf of their <mark class="term unknown">fellow-citizens</mark>. They came on foot to submit to him their petition. “God is our witness,” they
    pleaded, “that we harbour no intention but <a name="Page_339"></a>that of establishing peace and reconciliation between us. Remain seated on your charger
    for a while, until we have explained our motive.” Observing the earnestness of their appeal, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> dismounted and invited them to join him in the
    caravanserai. “We, unlike the people of this town, know how to receive the stranger in our midst,” he said, as he invited them to be seated beside him and
    ordered that they be served with tea. “The <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>,” they replied, “was alone responsible for having kindled the fire of so much mischief. The
    people of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> should in no wise he implicated in the crime which he has committed. Let the past be now forgotten. We would suggest, in the
    interest of both parties, that you and your companions leave <mark class="term unknown">to-morrow</mark> for <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark>. <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> is in the throes of great excitement; we fear lest they
may again be instigated to attack you.” <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, though hinting at the insincerity of the people, consented to their proposal; whereupon <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Laríjání</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Láríjání</mark><a href="#_ftn338" name="_ftnref338" title="">[†††††]</a> and <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Muṣṭafá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> arose together and, swearing by the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>
    which they had brought with them, solemnly declared their intention to regard them as their guests that night, and the following day to instruct <u>Kh</u><mark class="term unknown">usraw-i-Qádí-Kalá’í</mark><a href="#_ftn339" name="_ftnref339" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡]</a> and a hundred horsemen to ensure their safe passage through <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ír-Gáh</mark>.
    “The malediction of God and His Prophets be upon us, both in this world and <a name="Page_340"></a>in the next,” they added, “if we ever allow the
    slightest injury to be inflicted upon you and your party.”
<p></p><p>As soon as they had made their declaration, their friends who had gone to fetch food for the companions and fodder for their horses, arrived. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
bade his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-believers</mark> break their fast, inasmuch as none of them that day, which was Friday, the twelfth of the month of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Dh</u>i’l-Qádih</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Dh</u>i’l-Qa‘dih</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn340" name="_ftnref340" title="">[§§§§§]</a> had taken any meat or drink since the hour of dawn. So great was the number of notables and their
    attendants that had crowded into the caravanserai that day that neither he nor any of his companion had partaken of the tea which they had offered to their
    visitors.
</p>That night, about four hours after sunset, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, together with his friends, dined in the company of <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Muṣṭafá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. In the middle of that same night, the <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> summoned <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw-i-Qádí-Kalá’í</mark> and confidentially intimated to him his desire
    that, at any time or place he himself might decide, the entire property of the party which had been entrusted to his charge should be seized, and that they
    themselves, without a single exception, should be put to death. “Are these not the followers of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>?” <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark> observed. “Have not these same
    people, as I have already learned, preferred to sacrifice three of their companions rather than leave unfinished the call to prayer which they had raised?
    How could we, who cherish such designs and perpetrate such acts, be regarded as worthy of that name?” That shameless miscreant insisted that his orders be
    faithfully obeyed. “Slay them,” he said, as he pointed with his finger to his neck, “and be not afraid. I hold myself responsible for your act. I will, on
    the Day of Judgment, be answerable to God in your name. We, who wield the sceptre of authority, are surely better informed than you, and can better judge
    how best to extirpate this heresy.”
<p></p><p>At the hour of sunrise, <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> asked that <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark> be conducted into his presence, and bade him exercise the utmost consideration
towards <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and his companions, to ensure their safe passage through <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ír-Gáh</mark>, and to refuse whatever rewards they might wish to offer him.    <a name="Page_341"></a><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark> feigned submission to these instructions and assured him that neither he nor his horsemen would relax in their
    vigilance or flinch in their devotion to them. “On our return,” he added, “we shall show you his own written expression of satisfaction with the services
    we shall have rendered him.”
</p><p>When <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark> was taken by <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muṣṭafá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> and other representative leaders of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark> <mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> into the presence
    of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and was introduced to him, the latter remarked: “<mark class="term unknown">‘If</mark> ye do well, it will redound to your own advantage; and if ye do evil, the evil will
    return upon you.”<a href="#_ftn341" name="_ftnref341" title="">[******]</a> If this man should treat us well, great shall be his reward; and if he act
    treacherously towards us, great shall be his punishment. To God would we commit our Cause, and to His will are we wholly resigned.”
</p><p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> spoke these words and gave the signal for departure. Once more <mark class="term correct">Qambar-‘Alí</mark> was heard to raise the call of his master, “Mount your steeds, O
heroes of God!”—a summons which he invariably called out on such occasions. At the sound of those words, they all hurried to their steeds. A detachment of    <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark>’s horsemen marched before them. They were immediately followed by <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who rode abreast in the centre of the
    company. In their rear followed the rest of the companions, and on their right and left marched the remainder of the hundred horsemen whom <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark>
    had armed as willing instruments for the execution of his design. It had been agreed that the party should start early in the morning from <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark> <mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>
    and arrive on the same day at noon at <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ír-Gáh</mark>. Two hours after sunrise, they started for their destination. <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark> intentionally took the
    way of the forest, a route which he thought would better serve his purpose.
</p>As soon as they had penetrated it, he gave the signal for attack. His men fiercely threw themselves upon the companions, seized their property, killed a
    number, among whom was the brother of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark>, and captured the rest. As soon as the cry of agony and distress reached his ears, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> halted,
    and, alighting from his horse, protested against <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark>’s treacherous behaviour. “The hour of midday is long past,” he told him; “we still have not
    attained <a name="Page_342"></a>our destination. I refuse to proceed further with you; I can dispense with your guidance and company and that of your men.”
    Turning to <mark class="term correct">Qambar-‘Alí</mark>, he asked him to spread his <mark class="term unknown">prayer-mat</mark>, that he might offer his devotions. He was performing his ablutions, when <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark>, who
    had also dismounted, called one of his attendants and bade him inform <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> that if he wished to reach his destination safely, he should deliver to
    him both his sword and his horse. Refusing to give a reply, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> proceeded to offer his prayer. Shortly after, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Muḥammad-Taqíy-i-Juvayníy-i-Sabzívarí</mark>, a man of literary accomplishments and fearless courage, went to an attendant who was preparing the qulayn,    <a href="#_ftn342" name="_ftnref342" title="">[††††††]</a> and requested him to allow him to take it in person to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark>; a request that was
    readily granted. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark> was bending to kindle the fire of the qulayn, when, thrusting his hand suddenly into <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark>’s bosom, he drew
    his dagger from his robe and plunged it <mark class="term unknown">hilt-deep</mark> into his vitals.<a href="#_ftn343" name="_ftnref343" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><p></p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was still in the act of prayer when the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>”<a href="#_ftn344" name="_ftnref344" title="">[§§§§§§]</a> was raised again
    by his companions. They threw themselves upon their treacherous assailants and in one onslaught struck them all down except the attendant who had prepared
    the qulayn. Affrighted and defenceless, he fell at the feet of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and implored his aid. He was given the bejewelled qulayn which belonged to his
    master and was bidden to return to <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> and recount to <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> all that he had witnessed. “Tell him,” said <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, “how
    faithfully <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark> discharged his mission. That false miscreant foolishly imagined that my mission had come to an end, that both my sword and my
    horse had fulfilled their function. Little did he know that their work had but just begun, that until the services which they can render are entirely
    accomplished, neither his power nor the power of any man beside him can wrest them from me.”
<p></p><p>As the night was approaching, the party decided to tarry in that spot until the hour of dawn. At daybreak, after <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had offered his prayer, he
    gathered his companions <a name="Page_343"></a>together and said: “We are approaching our <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, our ultimate destination.” Immediately after, he set out
    on foot towards that spot, and was followed by his companions. Finding that a few were attempting to carry with them the belongings of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark> and
    of his men, he ordered them to leave everything behind except their swords and horses. “It behoves you,” he urged them, “to arrive at that hallowed spot in
    a state of complete detachment, wholly sanctified from all that pertains to this world.”<a href="#_ftn345" name="_ftnref345" title="">[*******]</a> He had
walked the distance of a <mark class="term correct">maydán</mark><a href="#_ftn346" name="_ftnref346" title="">[†††††††]</a> when he arrived at the shrine of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn347" name="_ftnref347" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> had been one of the transmitters of the traditions ascribed to the
    <mark class="term correct">imáms</mark> of the Faith, and his <mark class="term unknown">burial-place</mark> was visited by the people of the neighbourhood. On reaching that spot, he recited the following verse of the
    <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>: “O <a name="Page_344"></a>my Lord, bless Thou my arrival at this place, for Thou alone canst vouchsafe such blessings.”
</p><p>The night preceding their arrival, the guardian of the shrine dreamed that the <mark class="term misspelled">Siyyidu’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>uhada’</mark> <mark class="term correction">Siyyidu’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>uhadá’</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, had arrived at <u>Sh</u>
    ay<u>kh</u> <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, accompanied by no less than <mark class="term unknown">seventy-two</mark> warriors and a large number or his companions. He dreamed that they tarried in that spot,
    engaged in the most heroic of battles, triumphing in every encounter over the forces of the enemy, and that the Prophet of God, Himself, arrived one night
    and joined that blessed company. When <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> arrived on the following day, the guardian immediately recognised him as the hero he had seen in his
    vision, threw himself at his feet, and kissed them devoutly. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> invited him to be seated by his side, and heard him relate his story. “All that
    you <a name="Page_345"></a>have witnessed,” he assured the keeper of the shrine, “will come to pass. Those glorious scenes will again be enacted before
    your eyes.” That servant threw in his lot eventually with the heroic defenders of the fort and fell a martyr within its walls.
</p>On the very day of their arrival, which was the fourteenth of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Dh</u>i’l-Qádih</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Dh</u>i’l-Qa‘dih</mark>,<a href="#_ftn348" name="_ftnref348" title="">[§§§§§§§]</a><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
    gave <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark>, who had built the <mark class="term correct">Bábíyyih</mark>, the preliminary instructions regarding the design of the fort which was to be constructed for their
    defence. Towards the evening of the same day, they found themselves suddenly encompassed by an irregular multitude of horsemen who had emerged from the
    forest and were preparing to open fire upon them. “We are of the inhabitants of <mark class="term correct">Qádí-Kalá</mark>,” they shouted. “We come to avenge the blood of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark>.
Not until we have put you all to the sword shall we be satisfied.” Besieged by a savage crowd ready to pounce upon them, the party had to draw    <a name="Page_346"></a>their swords again in <mark class="term unknown">self-defence</mark>. Raising the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>,” they leaped forward, repulsed the assailants, and put
    them to flight. So tremendous was the shout, that the horsemen vanished as suddenly as they had appeared. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqíy-i-Juvayní</mark> had, at his own
    request, assumed the command of that encounter.
<p></p>Fearing that their assailants might again turn on them and resort to a general massacre, they pursued them until they reached a village which they thought
    to be the village of <mark class="term correct">Qádí-Kalá</mark>. At the sight of them, all the men fled in wild terror. The mother of <mark class="term misspelled">Nazar</mark><mark class="term correction">Naẓar</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the owner of the village, was
    inadvertently killed in the darkness of the night, amid the confusion that ensued. The outcries of the women, who were violently protesting that they had
    no connection whatever with the people of <mark class="term correct">Qádí-Kalá</mark>, soon reached the ears of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>, who immediately ordered his companions to withhold their
    hands until they ascertained the name and character of the place. They soon found out that the village belonged to <mark class="term misspelled">Nazar</mark><mark class="term correction">Naẓar</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> and that the woman who
    had lost her life was his mother. Greatly distressed at the discovery of so grievous a mistake on the part of his companions, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>
    sorrowfully exclaimed: “We did not intend to molest either the men or the women of this village. Our sole purpose was to curb the violence of the people of
    <mark class="term correct">Qádí-Kalá</mark>, who were about to put us all to death.” He apologised earnestly for the pitiful tragedy which his companions had unwittingly enacted.
<p></p><mark class="term misspelled">Nazar</mark><mark class="term correction">Naẓar</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who in the meantime had concealed himself in his house, was convinced of the sincerity of the regrets expressed by <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>.
    Though suffering from this grievous loss, he was moved to call upon him and to invite him to his home. He even asked <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark> to introduce him
    to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and expressed a keen desire to be made acquainted with the precepts of a Cause that could kindle such fervour in the breasts of its
    adherents.
<p></p>At the hour of dawn, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>, accompanied by <mark class="term misspelled">Nazar</mark><mark class="term correction">Naẓar</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, arrived at the shrine of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, and found <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
    leading the congregational prayer. Such was the rapture that glowed upon his countenance <a name="Page_347"></a>that <mark class="term misspelled">Nazar</mark><mark class="term correction">Naẓar</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> felt an irresistible
    impulse to join the worshippers and to repeat the very prayers that were then falling from their lips. After the completion of that prayer, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
    was informed of the loss which <mark class="term misspelled">Nazar</mark><mark class="term correction">Naẓar</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> had sustained. He expressed in the most touching language the sympathy which he and the entire company of
    his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> felt for him in his great bereavement. “God knows,” he assured him, “that our sole intention was to protect our lives rather than
    disturb the peace of the neighbourhood.” <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> then proceeded to relate the circumstances that had led to the attack directed against them by the
    people of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>, and explained the treacherous conduct of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark>. He again assured him of the sorrow which the death of his mother had
    caused him. “Afflict not your heart,” <mark class="term misspelled">Nazar</mark><mark class="term correction">Naẓar</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> spontaneously replied. “Would that a hundred sons had been given me, all of whom I would have
    joyously placed at your feet and offered as a sacrifice to the <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!” He pledged, that very moment, his undying loyalty to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and
    hastened back to his village in order to return with whatever provisions might be required for the party.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> ordered his companions to commence the building of the fort which had been designed. To every group he assigned a section of the work, and
    encouraged them to hasten its completion. In the course of these operations, they were continually harassed by the people of the neighbouring villages,
    who, at the persistent instigations of the <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>, marched out and fell upon them. Every attack of the enemy ended in failure and shame.
    Undeterred by the fierceness of their repeated onsets, the companions valiantly withstood their assaults until they had succeeded in subjugating
    temporarily the forces which had hemmed them in on every side. When the work of construction was completed, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> undertook the necessary
    preparations for the siege which the fort was destined to sustain, and provided, despite the obstacles which stood in his way, whatever seemed essential
    for the safety of its occupants.
<p></p>The work had scarcely been completed when <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark> arrived bearing the news of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s arrival at the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Nazar</mark><mark class="term correction">Naẓar</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. He informed <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><a name="Page_348"></a>that he had been specially commanded by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> to inform them that they all were to be
    His guests that night and that He Himself would join them that same afternoon. I have heard <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-Furú<u>gh</u>í</mark> recount the following:
    “The tidings which <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark> brought imparted an indefinable joy to the heart or <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. He hastened immediately to his
    companions and bade them bestir themselves for the reception of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. He himself joined them in sweeping and sprinkling with water the approaches to
    the shrine, and attended in person to whatever was necessary for the arrival of the beloved Visitor. As soon as he saw Him approaching with <mark class="term misspelled">Nazar</mark><mark class="term correction">Naẓar</mark><u>Kh</u><mark class="term unknown">án</mark>, he rushed forward, tenderly embraced Him, and conducted Him to the place of honour which he had reserved for His reception. We were too blind in those
days to recognise the glory of Him whom our leader had introduced with such reverence and love into our midst. What <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had perceived, our    <a name="Page_349"></a>dull vision was as yet unable to recognise. With what solicitude he received Him in his arms! What feelings of rapturous delight
    filled his heart on seeing Him! He was so lost in admiration that he was utterly oblivious of us all. His soul was so wrapt in contemplation of that
    countenance that we who were awaiting his permission to be seated were kept standing a long time beside him. It was <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> Himself who finally bade us
    be seated. We, too, were soon made to feel, however inadequately, the charm of His utterance, though none of us were even dimly aware of the infinite
    potency latent in His words.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, in the course of that visit, inspected the fort and expressed His satisfaction with the work that had been accomplished. In His conversation
    with <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, He explained in detail such matters as were vital to the welfare and safety of his companions. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> one thing this fort and company
    require,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He said, <mark class="term unknown">‘is</mark> the presence of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>. His association with this company would render it complete and perfect.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He instructed <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> to
    despatch <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Mihdíy-i-<u>Kh</u>ú’í</mark><mark class="term correction">Mihdíy-i-<u>Kh</u>u’í</mark> with six people to <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark><mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark>, and to demand <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark> that he immediately deliver <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> into their hands. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark>
    fear of God and the dread of His punishment,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He assured <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, <mark class="term unknown">‘will</mark> prompt him to surrender unhesitatingly his captive.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“Ere He departed, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> enjoined them to be patient and resigned to the will of the Almighty. <mark class="term unknown">‘If</mark> it be His will,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He added, <mark class="term unknown">‘We</mark> shall once again
    visit you at this same spot, and shall lend you Our assistance. You have been chosen of God to be the vanguard of His host and the establishers of His
    Faith. His host verily will conquer. Whatever may befall, victory is yours, a victory which is complete and certain.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> With these words, He committed those
    valiant companions to the care of God, and returned to the village with <mark class="term misspelled">Nazar</mark> <mark class="term correction">Naẓar</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> and <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark>. From thence He departed by
    way of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>.”
</p><p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> set out immediately to carry out the instructions he had received. Summoning <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark>, he bade him proceed together with six other
    companions to <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark> and ask that the <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> liberate his prisoner. As soon as the message was conveyed to him, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark> <a name="Page_350"></a>unconditionally acceded to their request. The potency with which that message had been endowed seemed to have completely disarmed him. “I have regarded
    him,” he hastened to assure the messengers, “only as an honoured guest in my house. It would be unbecoming of me to pretend to have dismissed or released
    him. He is at liberty to do as he desires. Should he wish it, I would be willing to accompany him.”
</p><p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had in the meantime apprised his companions of the approach of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, and had enjoined them to observe towards him a reverence such as they
    would feel prompted to show to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> Himself. “As to myself,” he added, “you must consider me as his lowly servant. You should bear him such loyalty that
    if he were to command you to take my life, you would unhesitatingly obey. If you waver or hesitate, you will have shown your disloyalty to your Faith. Not
    until he summons you to his presence must you in any wise venture to intrude upon him. You should forsake your desires and cling to his will and pleasure.
    You should refrain from kissing either his hands or his feet, for his blessed heart dislikes such evidences of reverent affection. Such should be your
    behaviour that I may feel proud of you before him. The glory and authority with which he has been invested must needs be duly recognised by even the most
    insignificant of his companions. Whoso departs from the spirit and letter of my admonitions, a grievous chastisement will surely overtake him.”
</p><p>The incarceration of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> in the home of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>, <a name="Page_351"></a><mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark>’s most eminent <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark>, to whom he was related, lasted five
    and ninety days. Though confined, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> was treated with marked deference, and was allowed to receive most of the companions who had been present at the
    gathering of <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark>. To none, however, did he grant permission to stay in <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark>. Whoever visited him was urged, in the most pressing terms, to
    enlist under the Black Standard hoisted by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. It was the same standard of which <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, the Prophet of God, had thus spoken: “Should your eyes
    behold the Black Standards proceeding from <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, hasten ye towards them, even though ye should have to crawl over the snow, inasmuch as they
    proclaim the advent of the promised <mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark>,<a href="#_ftn349" name="_ftnref349" title="">[********]</a> the Vicegerent of God.” That standard was unfurled
    at the command of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, in the name of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, and by the hands of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. It was carried aloft all the way from the city of <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark> to the
shrine of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. For eleven months, from the beginning of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>a’bán</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>a‘bán</mark> in the year 1264 A.H.<a href="#_ftn350" name="_ftnref350" title="">[††††††††]</a> to the end of <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádiyu’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Jamádíyu’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark>, in the year 1265 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn351" name="_ftnref351" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> that earthly emblem of an unearthly sovereignty waved continually over the heads of that small
    and valiant band, summoning the multitude who gazed upon it to renounce the world and to espouse the Cause of God.
</p>While in <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark><mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> frequently attempted to convince <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark> of the truth of the Divine Message. He freely conversed with him on the most
    weighty and outstanding issues related to the Revelation of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. His bold and challenging remarks were couched in such gentle, such persuasive and
    courteous language, and delivered with such geniality and humour, that those who heard him felt not in the least offended. They even misconstrued his
    allusions to the sacred Book as humorous observations intended to entertain his hearers. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>, despite the cruelty and wickedness that were
latent in him and which he subsequently manifested by the stand he took in insisting upon the extermination of the remnants of the defenders of the fort of    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, was withheld by an inner power from showing the least disrespect to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> while the latter was confined in his home. He even
    was prompted to prevent <a name="Page_352"></a>the inhabitants of <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark><mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark> from offending <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, and was often heard to rebuke them for the harm which they
    desired to inflict upon him.
<p></p>The news of the impending arrival of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> bestirred the occupants of the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. As he drew near his destination, he sent forward a messenger to
    announce his approach. The joyful tidings gave them new courage and strength. Roused to a burst of enthusiasm which he could not repress, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
    started to his feet and, escorted by about a hundred of his companions, hastened to meet the expected visitor. He placed two candles in the hands of each,
    lighted them himself, and bade them proceed to meet <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>. The darkness of the night was dispelled by the radiance which those joyous hearts shed as they
    marched forth to meet their beloved. In the midst of the forest of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, their eyes instantly recognised the face which they had longed to behold.
    They pressed eagerly around his steed, and with every mark of devotion aid him their tribute of love and undying allegiance. Still holding the lighted
    candles in their hands, they followed him on foot towards their destination. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, as he rode along in their midst, appeared as the <mark class="term unknown">day-star</mark> that shines
    amidst its satellites. As the company slowly wended its way towards the fort, there broke forth the hymn of glorification and praise intoned by the band of
    his enthusiastic admirers. “Holy, holy, the Lord our God, the Lord of the angels and the spirit!” rang their jubilant voices around him. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
    raised the glad refrain, to which the entire company responded. The forest of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark><mark class="term unknown">re-echoed</mark> to the sound of their acclamations.
<p></p>In this manner they reached the shrine of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. The first words that fell from the lips of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> after he had dismounted and
    leaned against the shrine were the following: “The <mark class="term correct">Baqíyyatu’lláh</mark><a href="#_ftn352" name="_ftnref352" title="">[§§§§§§§§]</a> will be best for you if ye
    are of those who believe.”<a href="#_ftn353" name="_ftnref353" title="">[*********]</a> By this utterance was fulfilled the prophecy of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> as
    recorded in the following tradition: “And when the <mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark><a href="#_ftn354" name="_ftnref354" title="">[†††††††††]</a> is made manifest, He shall lean His
    back against the <mark class="term misspelled">Ka’bih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ka‘bih</mark> and shall address to the three hundred and thirteen followers who will have grouped around Him, these words: <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark><mark class="term correct">Baqíyyatu’lláh</mark>
    will be best for you if <a name="Page_353"></a>ye are of those who believe.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” By “<mark class="term correct">Baqíyyatu’lláh</mark>” <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> meant none other than <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. To this
    testified <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-Furú<u>gh</u>í</mark>, who related to me the following: “I myself was present when <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> alighted from his horse. I saw him lean
    against the shrine and heard him utter those same words. No sooner had he spoken them than he made mention of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and, turning to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>,
    enquired about Him. He was informed that unless God decreed to the contrary, He had signified His intention to return to this place before the first day of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark>.<a href="#_ftn355" name="_ftnref355" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><p></p>“Shortly after, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> entrusted to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> a number of homilies which he asked him to read aloud to his assembled companions. The first homily he
    read was entirely devoted to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, the second concerned <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, and the third referred to <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>. We ventured to express to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> our
    doubts whether the references in the second homily were applicable to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, who appeared clothed in the garb of nobility. The matter was reported to
    <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, who assured us that, God willing, its secret would be revealed to us in due time. Utterly unaware, in those days, of the character of the Mission
    of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, we were unable to understand the meaning of those allusions, and idly conjectured as to what could be their probable significance. In my
    eagerness to unravel the subtleties of the traditions concerning the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>, I several times approached <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and requested him to enlighten me
    regarding that subject. Though at first reluctant, he eventually acceded to my wish. The manner of his answer, his convincing and illuminating
    explanations, served to heighten the sense of awe and of veneration which his presence inspired. He dispelled whatever doubts lingered in our minds, and
    such were the evidences of his perspicacity that we came to believe that to him had been given the power to read our profoundest thoughts and to calm the
    fiercest tumult in our hearts.
<p></p>“Many a night I saw <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> circle round the shrine within the precincts of which <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> lay asleep. How often did I see him emerge in the <mark class="term unknown">mid-watches</mark>
    of the night from his chamber and quietly direct his steps to that spot and whisper the same verse with which we all had greeted <a name="Page_354"></a>the
    arrival of the beloved visitor! With what feelings of emotion I can still remember him as he advanced towards me, in the stillness of those dark and lonely
    hours which I devoted to meditation and prayer, whispering in my ears these words: <mark class="term unknown">‘Banish</mark> from your mind, O <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, these perplexing
subtleties and, freed from their trammels, arise and seek with me to quaff the cup of martyrdom. Then will you be able to comprehend, as the year <mark class="term unknown">’</mark>80    <a href="#_ftn356" name="_ftnref356" title="">[§§§§§§§§§]</a> dawns upon the world, the secret of the things which now lie hidden from you.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, on his arrival at the shrine of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, charged <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> to ascertain the number of the assembled companions. One by one
    he counted them and passed them in through the gate of the fort: three hundred and twelve in all. He himself was entering the fort in order to acquaint
    <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> with the result, when a youth, who had hastened all the way on foot from <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark> <mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>, suddenly rushed in and seizing the hem of his garment,
    pleaded to be enrolled among the companions and to be allowed to lay down his life, whenever required, in the path of the Beloved. His wish was readily
    granted. When <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> was informed of the total number of the companions, he remarked: “Whatever the tongue of the Prophet of God has spoken concerning the
    promised One must needs be fulfilled,<a href="#_ftn357" name="_ftnref357" title="">[**********]</a> that thereby His testimony may be complete in the eyes
    of those divines who esteem themselves as the sole interpreters of the law and traditions of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. Through them will the people recognise the truth and
    acknowledge the fulfilment of these traditions.”<a href="#_ftn358" name="_ftnref358" title="">[††††††††††]</a> <a name="Page_355"></a>Every morning and every afternoon during those days, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> would summon <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and the most distinguished among his companions and ask them to chant
    the writings of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. Seated in the <mark class="term correct">Maydán</mark>, the open square adjoining the fort, and surrounded by his devoted friends, he would listen intently to the
    utterances of his Master and would occasionally be heard to comment upon them. Neither the threats of the enemy nor the fierceness of their successive
    onsets could induce him to abate the fervour, or to break the regularity, of his devotions. Despising all danger and oblivious of his own needs and wants,
    he continued, even under the most distressing circumstances, his daily communion with his Beloved, wrote his praises of Him, and roused to fresh exertions
    the defenders of the fort. Though exposed to the bullets that kept ceaselessly raining upon his besieged companions, he, undeterred by the ferocity of the
    attack, pursued his labours in a state of unruffled calm. “My soul is wedded to Thy mention!” he was wont to exclaim. “Remembrance of Thee is the stay and
    solace of my life! I glory in that I was the first to suffer ignominiously for Thy <a name="Page_356"></a>sake in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. I long to be the first to
    suffer in Thy path a death that shall be worthy of Thy Cause.”
</p><p>He would sometimes ask his <mark class="term misspelled">Iráqí</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Iráqí</mark> companions to chant various passages of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, to which he would listen with close attention, and would often be
    moved to unfold their meaning. In the course of one of their chantings, they came across the following verse: “With somewhat of fear and hunger, and loss
    of wealth and lives and fruits, will We surely prove you: but bear good tidings to the patient.” “These words,” <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> would remark, “were originally
    revealed with reference to Job and the afflictions that befell him. In this day, however, they are applicable to us, who are destined to suffer those same
    afflictions. Such will be the measure of our calamity that none but he who has been endowed with constancy and patience will be able to survive them.”
</p><p>The knowledge and sagacity which <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> displayed on those occasions, the confidence with which he spoke, and the resource and enterprise which he
demonstrated in the instructions he gave to his companions, reinforced his authority and enhanced his prestige. These at first supposed that the profound    <a name="Page_357"></a>reverence which <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> showed towards him was dictated by the exigencies of the situation rather than prompted by a
    spontaneous feeling of devotion to his person. His own writings and general behaviour gradually dispelled such doubts and served to establish him still
    more firmly in the esteem of his companions. In the days of his confinement in the town of <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, whom <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark> had requested to write a
    commentary on the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">I<u>kh</u>las</mark> <mark class="term correction">I<u>kh</u>láṣ</mark>, better known as the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of Qul <mark class="term misspelled">Huva’lláhu’l-Ahad</mark> <mark class="term correction">Huva’lláhu’l-Aḥad</mark>, composed, in his interpretation of the <mark class="term correct">Sád</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Samad</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣamad</mark> alone, a
    treatise which was thrice as voluminous as the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> itself. That exhaustive and masterly exposition had profoundly impressed <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark> and had
    been responsible for the marked consideration which he showed towards <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, although in the end he joined the <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> in compassing the death of
    the heroic martyrs of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> continued, while besieged in that fort, to write his commentary on that <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark>, and was able,
    despite the vehemence of the enemy’s onslaught, to pen as many verses as he had previously written in <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark> in his interpretation of that same letter. The
    rapidity and copiousness of his composition, the inestimable treasures which his writings revealed, filled his companions with wonder and justified his
    leadership in their eyes. They read eagerly the pages of that commentary which <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> brought to them each day and to which he paid his share of
    tribute.
</p>The completion of the fort, and the provision of whatever was deemed essential for its defence, animated the enthusiasm of the companions of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
    and excited the curiosity of the people of the neighbourhood.<a href="#_ftn359" name="_ftnref359" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> A few out of sheer curiosity,
    others in pursuit of material interest, and still others prompted by their devotion to the Cause which that building symbolised, sought to be admitted
within its walls and marvelled at the rapidity with which it had been raised. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> had no sooner ascertained the number of its occupants    <a name="Page_358"></a>than he ordered that no visitor be allowed to enter it. The praises which those who had already inspected the fort had lavished upon
    it were transmitted from mouth to mouth until they reached the ears of the <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> and kindled within his breast the flame of unrelenting
    jealousy. In his detestation of those who had been responsible for its erection, he issued the strictest prohibition against anyone’s approaching its
    precincts and urged all to boycott the companions of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. Despite the stringency of his orders, a few were found to disregard his wishes and to
    render whatever assistance was in their power to those whom he had so undeservedly persecuted. The afflictions to which these sufferers were subjected were
    such that at times they felt a distressing need of the bare necessities of life. In their dark hour of adversity, however, there would suddenly break upon
    them the light of Divine deliverance opening before their face the door of unexpected relief.
<p></p>The providential manner in which the occupants of the fort were relieved of the distress which weighed upon them fanned to fury the wrath of the wilful and
    imperious <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>. Impelled by an implacable hatred, he addressed a burning appeal to <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, who had recently ascended the
    throne, and expatiated upon the danger with which his dynasty, nay the monarchy itself, was menaced. “The standard of revolt,” he pleaded, “has been raised
    by the contemptible sect of the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>. This wretched band of irresponsible agitators has dared to strike at the very foundations of the authority with
    which your Imperial Majesty has been invested. The inhabitants of a number of villages in the immediate vicinity of their headquarters have already flown
    to their standard and sworn allegiance to their cause. They have built themselves a fort, and in that massive stronghold they have entrenched themselves,
    ready to direct a campaign against you. With unswerving obstinacy they <a name="Page_359"></a>have resolved to proclaim their independent sovereignty, a
    sovereignty that shall abase to the dust the imperial diadem of your illustrious ancestors. You stand at the threshold of your reign. What greater triumph
    could signalise the inauguration of your rule than to extirpate this hateful creed that has dared to conspire against you? It will serve to establish your
    Majesty in the confidence of your people. It will enhance your prestige, and invest your crown with imperishable glory. Should you vacillate in your
    policy, should you betray the least indulgence towards them, I feel it my duty to warn you that the day is fast approaching when not only the province of
    <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> but the whole of Persia, from end to end, will have repudiated your authority and will have surrendered to their cause.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, as yet inexperienced in the affairs of State, referred the matter to the officers who commanded the army of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> and who
    were in attendance upon him.<a href="#_ftn360" name="_ftnref360" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§]</a> He instructed them to take whatever means they deemed fit for
    the eradication of the disturbers of his realm. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muṣṭafá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Turkamán</mark> submitted his views to his sovereign: “I myself come from <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>. I
    have been able to estimate the forces at their disposal. The handful of untrained and <mark class="term unknown">frail-bodied</mark> students whom I have seen are utterly powerless to
    withstand the forces which your Majesty can command. The army which you contemplate despatching is in my view unnecessary. A small detachment of that army
    will be sufficient to wipe them out. They are utterly unworthy of the care and consideration of my sovereign. Should your Majesty be willing to signify
    your desire, in an imperial message addressed to my brother <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’lláh</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Turkamán</mark>, <a name="Page_360"></a>that he should be given the necessary
    authority to subjugate that band, I am convinced that he will, within the space of two days, quell their rebellion and shatter their hopes.”
</p><p>The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> gave his consent, and issued his <mark class="term correct">farmán</mark><a href="#_ftn361" name="_ftnref361" title="">[***********]</a> to that same <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’lláh</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>,
    bidding him to recruit without delay, from any part of his realm, the forces he might require for the execution of his purpose. He sent with his message a
    royal badge, which he bestowed upon him as a mark of confidence in his capacity to undertake that task. The receipt of the imperial <mark class="term correct">farmán</mark> and the token of
    the honour which his sovereign had conferred upon him nerved him to fresh resolve to carry out his mission befittingly. Within a short space of time, he
had raised an army of about twelve thousand men, composed largely of the <mark class="term misspelled">Usanlu</mark> <mark class="term correction">Usanlú</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Af<u>gh</u>án</mark>, and the <mark class="term misspelled">Kudar</mark> <mark class="term correction">Kúdár</mark> communities.    <a href="#_ftn362" name="_ftnref362" title="">[†††††††††††]</a> He equipped them with whatever ammunition was required, and stationed them in the village
    of <mark class="term misspelled">Afra</mark> <mark class="term correction">Afrá</mark>, which was the property of <mark class="term misspelled">Nazar</mark> <mark class="term correction">Naẓar</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, and <a name="Page_361"></a>which commanded the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. No sooner had he fixed his camp upon
    that eminence than he set out to intercept the bread which was being daily conveyed to the companions of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. Even water was soon to be denied
    them, as it became impossible for the besieged to leave the fort under the fire of the enemy.
</p>The army was ordered to set up a number of barricades in front of the fort and to open fire upon anyone who chanced to leave its gate. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> forbade his
    companions to go out in order to fetch water from the neighbourhood. “Our bread has been intercepted by our enemy,” complained <mark class="term misspelled">Rasul-i-Bahnimírí</mark><mark class="term correction">Rasúl-i-Bahnimírí</mark>. “What
    will befall us if water should likewise be denied us?” <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, who was at that time, the hour of sunset, viewing the army of the enemy in company with
    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> from the terrace of the fort, turned to him and said: “The scarcity of water has distressed our companions. God willing, this very night a
    downpour of rain will overtake our opponents, followed by a heavy snowfall, which will assist us to repulse their contemplated assault.”
<p></p><p>That very night, the army of <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’lláh</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was surprised by a torrential rain which overwhelmed that section which lay close to the fort. Much of
    the ammunition was irretrievably ruined. There gathered within the walls of the fort an amount of water which, for a long period, was sufficient for the
    consumption of the besieged. In the course of the following night, a snowfall such as the people of the neighbourhood even in the depth of winter had never
    experienced, added considerably to the annoyance which the rain had caused. The next night, which was the evening preceding the fifth of <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark>, in the
    year 1265 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn363" name="_ftnref363" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> determined to leave the gate of the fort. “Praise be to God,” he
    remarked to <mark class="term misspelled">Rasul-i-Bahnimírí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Rasúl-i-Bahnimírí</mark> as he paced with calm and serenity the approaches to the gate, “who has graciously answered our prayer and caused both rain
    and snow to fall upon our enemies; a fall that has brought desolation into their camp and refreshment into our fort.”
</p><p>As the hour of the attack approached for which that numerous army, despite the losses it had sustained, was strenuously preparing, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> determined to
    sally out and <a name="Page_362"></a>scatter its forces. Two hours after sunrise, he mounted his steed and, escorted by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and three other of his
    companions, all of whom were riding beside him, marched out of the gate, followed by the entire company on foot behind them. As soon as they had emerged,
    there pealed out the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!”<a href="#_ftn364" name="_ftnref364" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§]</a>—a cry that diffused consternation through
    the camp of the enemy. The roar which these <mark class="term unknown">lion-hearted</mark> followers of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> raised amidst the forest of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> dispersed the affrighted enemy that
    lay in ambush within its recesses. The glitter of their bared weapons dazzled their sight, and its menace was sufficient to stun and overpower them. They
    fled in disgraceful rout before their onrush, leaving all possessions behind them. Within the space of <mark class="term unknown">forty-five</mark> minutes, the shout of victory had been
    raised. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had succeeded in bringing under their control the remnants of the defeated army. <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’lláh</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Turkamán</mark>, with
    two of his officers, <mark class="term misspelled">Habíbu’lláh</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥabíbu’lláh</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Af<u>gh</u>án</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Núru’lláh</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Af<u>gh</u>án</mark>, together with no less than four hundred and thirty
    of their men, had perished.
</p><mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> returned to the fort while <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was still engaged in pursuing the work which had been so valiantly performed. The voice of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">‘Abdu’l-’Azim-i-<u>Kh</u>ú’í</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abdu’l-‘Aẓím-i-<u>Kh</u>u’í</mark> was soon raised summoning him, on behalf of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, to return immediately to the fort. “We have repulsed the assailants,”    <a name="Page_363"></a><mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> remarked; “we need not carry further the punishment. Our purpose is to protect ourselves that we may be able to continue our
    labours for the regeneration of men. We have no intention whatever of causing unnecessary harm to anyone. What we have already achieved is sufficient
    testimony to God’s invincible power. We, a little band of His followers, have been able, through His sustaining grace, to overcome the organised and
    trained army of our enemies.”
<p></p><p>Despite this defeat, not one of the followers of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> lost his life in the course of that encounter. No one except a man named <mark class="term correct">Qulí</mark>, who rode in advance
    of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, was badly wounded. They were all commanded to take none of the property of their adversaries excepting their swords and horses.
</p>As the signs of the reassembling of the forces which had been commanded by <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’lláh</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> became apparent, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> bade his companions dig a moat
    around the fort as a safeguard against a renewed attack. Nineteen days elapsed during which they exerted themselves to the utmost for the completion of the
    task they had been charged to perform. They joyously laboured by day and by night in order to expedite the work with which they had been entrusted. Soon
    after the work was completed, it was announced that Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><a href="#_ftn365" name="_ftnref365" title="">[************]</a> was advancing
    towards the fort at the head of a numerous army, and had actually encamped at <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ír-Gáh</mark>. A few days later, he had transferred his headquarters to
    <mark class="term misspelled">Vas-Kas</mark><mark class="term correction">Vás-Kas</mark>. On his arrival, he sent one of his men to inform <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> that he had been commanded by the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> to ascertain the purpose of his
    activities and to request that he be enlightened as to the object he had in view. “Tell your master,” <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> replied, “that we utterly disclaim any
    intention either of subverting <a name="Page_364"></a>Illustrations: VILLAGE OF <mark class="term misspelled">RIZ-AB</mark><mark class="term correction">RÍZ-ÁB</mark>; VILLAGE OF <mark class="term misspelled">FIRUZ-KÚH</mark><mark class="term correction">FÍRÚZ-KÚH</mark>; VILLAGE OF <mark class="term misspelled">VAS-KAS</mark><mark class="term correction">VÁS-KAS</mark>] <a name="Page_365"></a>the foundations of the monarchy or of usurping the
    authority of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>. Our Cause concerns the revelation of the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> and is primarily associated with the interests of the
    ecclesiastical order of this country. We can set forth incontrovertible arguments and deduce infallible proofs in support of the truth of the Message we
    bear.” The passionate sincerity with which <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> pleaded in defence of his Cause, and the details which he cited to demonstrate the validity of his
    claims, touched the heart of the messenger and brought tears to his eyes. “What are we to do?” he exclaimed. “Let the prince,” <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> replied,
    “direct the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of both <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark><mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> to betake themselves to this place, and ask us to demonstrate the validity of the Revelation
    proclaimed by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. Let the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> decide as to who speaks the truth. Let the prince himself judge our case and pronounce the verdict. Let him also
    decide as to how he should treat us if we fail to establish, by the aid of verses and traditions, the truth of this Cause.” The messenger expressed his
    complete satisfaction with the answer he had received, and promised that before the lapse of three days the ecclesiastical dignitaries would be convened in
    the manner he had suggested.
<p></p>The promise given by the messenger was destined to remain unfulfilled. Three days after, Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> prepared to launch his attack, on a scale
    hitherto unprecedented, upon the occupants of the fort. At the head of three regiments of infantry and several regiments of cavalry, he quartered his host
    upon a height that overlooked that spot, and gave the signal to open fire in that direction.
<p></p>The day had not yet broken when at the signal, “Mount your steeds, O heroes of God!” <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> ordered that the gates of the fort be again thrown open. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and two hundred and two of his companions ran to their horses and followed <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> as he rode out in the direction of <mark class="term misspelled">Vas-Kas</mark><mark class="term correction">Vás-Kas</mark>. Undaunted by the
    overwhelming forces arrayed against them, and undeterred by the snow and mud which had accumulated on the roads, they headed, without a pause, in the midst
    of the darkness that surrounded them, towards the stronghold which served as a base for the operations of the enemy. <a name="Page_366"></a>The prince, who was observing the movements of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, saw him approaching, from his fort, and ordered his men to open fire upon him. The bullets
    which they discharged were powerless to check his advance. He forced his way through the gate and rushed into the private apartments of the prince, who,
with a sudden sense that his life was in danger, threw himself from a back window into the moat and escaped barefooted.    <a href="#_ftn366" name="_ftnref366" title="">[††††††††††††]</a> His host, deprived of their leader and struck with panic, fled in disgraceful rout before
    that little band which, despite their own overwhelming numbers and the resources which the imperial treasury had placed at their disposal, they were unable
    to subdue.<a href="#_ftn367" name="_ftnref367" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><p></p>As the victors were forcing their way through the section of the fort reserved for the prince, two other princes of royal blood    <a href="#_ftn368" name="_ftnref368" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> fell in an attempt to strike down their opponents. As they penetrated his apartments, they
    discovered, in one <a name="Page_367"></a>of his rooms, coffers filled with gold and silver, all of which they disdained to touch. With the exception of a
    pot of gunpowder and the favourite sword of the prince which they carried as an evidence of their triumph to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, his companions ignored the
    costly furnishings which their owner had abandoned in his despair. When they took it to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, they discovered that he had, as a result of the
    bullet which had struck his own sword, exchanged it for that of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, with which he was engaged in repulsing the assailant.
<p></p>They were throwing open the gate of the prison which had been in the hands of the enemy, when they heard the voice of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Yúsúf-i-Ardibílí</mark><mark class="term correction">Yúsuf-i-Ardibílí</mark>, who had been
    made a captive on his way to the fort and was languishing among the prisoners. He interceded for his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-sufferers</mark> and succeeded in obtaining their
    immediate release.
<p></p>On the morning of that memorable engagement, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> assembled his companions around <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> in the outskirts of <mark class="term misspelled">Vas-Kas</mark><mark class="term correction">Vás-Kas</mark>, while he remained himself on
    horseback in anticipation of a renewed attack by the enemy. He was watching their movements, when he suddenly observed an innumerable host rushing from
    both sides towards him. All sprang to their feet and, raising again the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!” pressed forward to face the challenge. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
    spurred his charger in one direction, and <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and his companions in another. The detachment which was charging <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> suddenly deflected its
    course and, fleeing from before him, joined forces with the rest of the enemy and encompassed <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and those who were with him. At a given moment, they
    discharged a thousand bullets, one of which struck <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> in the mouth, knocking out several of his teeth and wounding both his tongue and throat. The loud
noise which the simultaneous discharge of a thousand bullets produced, and which could be heard at a distance of ten <mark class="term correct">farsangs</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn369" name="_ftnref369" title="">[*************]</a> filled with apprehension <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who hastened to the rescue of his friends. As soon
    as he reached them, he alighted from his horse and, entrusting it to his attendant, <mark class="term correct">Qambar-‘Alí</mark>, ran towards <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>. The sight of blood dripping profusely
    from the mouth of his beloved chief <a name="Page_368"></a>struck him with fear and dismay. He raised his hands in horror and was on the point of beating
    himself upon the head when <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> bade him desist. Obeying his leader instantly, he begged him to be allowed to receive his sword from his hand, which, as
    soon as it had been delivered, was unsheathed from its scabbard and used to scatter the forces that had massed around him. Followed by a hundred and ten of
    his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>, he faced the forces arrayed against him. Wielding in one hand the sword of his beloved leader and in the other that of his disgraced
    opponent, he fought a desperate battle against them, and within thirty minutes, during which he displayed marvellous heroism, he succeeded in putting the
    entire army to flight.
<p></p>The disgraceful retreat of the army of Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> enabled <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and his companions to repair to the fort. With pain and regret, they
    conducted their wounded leader to the shelter of his stronghold. On his arrival, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> addressed a written appeal to his friends who were bewailing his
    injury, and by his words of cheer soothed their sorrow. “We should submit,” he exhorted them, “to whatever is the will of God. We should stand firm and
    steadfast in the hour of trial. The stone of the infidel broke the teeth of the Prophet of God; mine have fallen as a result of the bullet of the enemy.
    Though my body be afflicted, my soul is immersed in gladness. My gratitude to God knows no bounds. If you love me, suffer not that this joy be obscured by
    the sight of your lamentations.”
<p></p><p>This memorable engagement fell on the <mark class="term unknown">twenty-fifth</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark>, 1265 A.H.<a href="#_ftn370" name="_ftnref370" title="">[†††††††††††††]</a> In the beginning
    of that same month, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, faithful to the promise He had given to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, set out, attended by a number of His friends, from <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> for the fort
    of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. Among those who accompanied Him were <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Janiy-i-Ká<u>sh</u>ání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Jáníy-i-Ká<u>sh</u>ání</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Báqir-i-Tabrízí</mark>, one of the Letters of the Living, and <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark>, His brother. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had signified His wish that they should proceed directly to their destination and allow no pause in their journey. His
    intention was to reach that spot at night, inasmuch as strict orders had been issued, ever since <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’lláh</mark> <a name="Page_369"></a><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> had assumed
    the command, that no help should be extended, under any circumstances, to the occupants of the fort. Guards had been stationed at different places to
    ensure the isolation of the besieged. His companions, however, pressed Him to interrupt the journey and to seek a few hours of rest. Although He knew that
    this delay would involve a grave risk of being surprised by the enemy, He yielded to their earnest request. They halted at a lonely house adjoining the
    road. After supper, his companions all retired to sleep. He alone, despite the hardships He had endured, remained wakeful. He knew well the perils to which
    He and His friends were exposed, and was fully aware of the possibilities which His early arrival at the fort involved.
</p>As He watched beside them, the secret emissaries of the enemy informed the guards of the neighbourhood of the arrival of the party, and ordered the
    immediate seizure of whatever they could find in their possession. “We have received strict orders, they told <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, whom they recognised instantly
    as the leader of the group, “to arrest every person we chance to meet in this vicinity, and are commanded to conduct him, without any previous
    investigation, to <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark> and deliver him into the hands of its governor.” “The matter has been misrepresented in your eyes,” <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> remarked. “You have
    misconstrued our purpose. I would advise you to act in a manner that will cause you eventually no regret.” This admonition, uttered with dignity and calm,
    induced the chief of the guards to treat with consideration and courtesy those whom he had arrested. He bade them mount their horses and proceed with him
    to <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark>. As they were approaching the banks of a river, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> signalled to His companions, who were riding at a distance from the guards, to cast
    into the water whatever manuscripts they had in their possession.
<p></p>At daybreak, as they were approaching the town, a message was sent in advance to the acting governor, informing him of the arrival of a party that had been
    captured on their way to the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. The governor himself, together with the members of his <mark class="term unknown">body-guard</mark>, had been appointed to join the army of
    Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, and had commissioned hiskinsman to act in his absence. As <a name="Page_370"></a>soon as the message reached him, he went to the
    <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark> and summoned the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> and leading siyyids of the town to gather and meet the party. He was greatly surprised as soon as his eyes saw and
    recognised <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, and deeply regretted the orders he had given. He feigned to reprimand Him for the action He had taken, in the hope of appeasing the
    tumult and allaying the excitement of those who had gathered in the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>. “We are innocent,” <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> declared, “of the guilt they impute to us. Our
    blamelessness will eventually be established in your eyes. I would advise you to act in a manner that will cause you eventually no regret.” The acting
    governor asked the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> who were present to put any question they desired. <a name="Page_371"></a>To their enquiries <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> returned explicit and
    convincing replies. As they were interrogating Him, they discovered a manuscript in the possession of one of His companions which they recognised as the
    writings of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and which they handed to the chief of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> present at that gathering. As soon as he had perused a few lines of that manuscript,
    he laid it aside and, turning to those around him, exclaimed: “These people, who advance such extravagant claims, have, in this very sentence which I have
    read, betrayed their ignorance of the most rudimentary rules of orthography.” “Esteemed and learned divine,” <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> replied, “these words which you
    criticise are not the words of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. They have been uttered by no less a personage than the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, the Commander of the Faithful, in his reply to
    <mark class="term misspelled">Kumayl-ibn-i-Ziyad</mark><mark class="term correction">Kumayl-ibn-i-Zíyád</mark>, whom he had chosen as his companion.”
<p></p><p>The circumstances which <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> proceeded to relate in connection with the reply, no less than the manner of His delivery, convinced the arrogant
    <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> of his stupidity and blunder. Unable to contradict so weighty a statement, he preferred to keep silent. A siyyid angrily interjected: “This very
    statement conclusively demonstrates that its author is himself a <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> and no less than a leading expounder of the tenets of that sect.” He urged in
    vehement language that its followers be put to death. “These obscure sectarians are the sworn enemies,” he cried, “both of the State and of the Faith of
    <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>! We must, at all costs, extirpate that heresy.” He was seconded in his denunciation by the other siyyids who were present, and who, emboldened by the
    imprecations uttered at that gathering, insisted that the governor comply unhesitatingly with their wishes.
</p>The acting governor was much embarrassed, and realised that any evidence of indulgence on his part would be fraught with grave consequences for the safety
    of his position. In his desire to hold in check the passions which had been aroused, he ordered his attendants to prepare the rods and promptly inflict a
    befitting punishment upon the captives. “We will afterwards,” he added, “keep them in prison pending the return of the governor, who will send them to
    <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, <a name="Page_372"></a>where they will receive, at the hands of the sovereign, the chastisement they deserve.”
<p></p><p>The first who was bound to receive the bastinado was <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Báqir</mark>. “I am only a groom of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>,” he urged. “I was on my way to <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark> when
    they suddenly arrested me and brought me to this place.” <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> intervened and succeeded in inducing his oppressors to release him. He likewise
    interceded for <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Jání</mark>, who He said was “a mere tradesman” whom He regarded as His “guest,” so that He was “responsible for any charges brought
    against him.” <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark>, whom they proceeded to bind, was also set free as soon as <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had declared him to be His attendant. “None of these men,”
    He told the acting governor, “are guilty of any crime. If you insist on inflicting your punishment, I offer Myself as a willing Victim of your
    chastisement.” The acting governor was reluctantly compelled to give orders that <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> alone be chosen to suffer the indignity which he had intended
    originally for His companions.<a href="#_ftn371" name="_ftnref371" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a>
</p>The same treatment that had been <mark class="term unknown">me-ed</mark> out to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> five months previously in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> suffered in the presence of the assembled <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of
<mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark>. The first confinement that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> suffered at the hands of His enemies was in the house of <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the chief constable of    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>; the first confinement of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was in the home of one of the <mark class="term correct">kad-<u>kh</u>udás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s second imprisonment was in the
castle of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>; that of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was in the private residence of the governor of <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark>. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was scourged in the <mark class="term correct">namáz-<u>kh</u>ánih</mark><a href="#_ftn372" name="_ftnref372" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>u’l-Islám</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>; the same indignity was inflicted on
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in the <mark class="term correct">namáz-<u>kh</u>ánih</mark> of the <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark>. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s third confinement was in the castle of <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>; <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s was in the
    <mark class="term correct">Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál</mark><a href="#_ftn373" name="_ftnref373" title="">[**************]</a> of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, whose trials and sufferings had preceded, in almost
    every case, <a name="Page_373"></a>those of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, had offered Himself to ransom His Beloved from the perils that beset that precious Life; whilst
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, on His part, unwilling that He who so greatly loved Him should be the sole Sufferer, shared at every turn the cup that had touched His lips.
    Such love no eye has ever beheld, nor has mortal heart conceived such mutual devotion. If the branches of every tree were turned into pens, and all the
    seas into ink, and earth and heaven rolled into one parchment, the immensity of that love would still remain unexplored, and the depths of that devotion
    unfathomed.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and His companions remained for a time imprisoned in one of the rooms that formed part of the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>. <a name="Page_374"></a>The acting
    governor, who was still determined to shield his Prisoner from the assaults of an inveterate enemy, secretly instructed his attendants to open, at an
    unsuspected hour, a passage through the wall of the room in which the captives were confined, and to transfer their Leader immediately to his home. He was
    himself conducting <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> to his residence when a siyyid sprang forward and, directing his fiercest invectives against Him, raised the club which he
    held in his hand to strike Him. The acting governor immediately interposed himself and, appealing to the assailant, “adjured him by the Prophet of God” to
    stay his hand. “What!” burst forth the siyyid. “How dare you release a man who is the sworn enemy of the Faith of our fathers?” A crowd of ruffians had
    meanwhile gathered around him, and by their howls of derision and abuse added to the clamour which he had raised. Despite the growing tumult, the
    attendants of the acting governor were able to conduct <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in safety to the residence of their master, and displayed on that occasion a courage and
    presence of mind that were truly surprising.
<p></p>Despite the protestations of the mob, the rest of the prisoners were taken to the seat of government, and thus escaped from the perils with which they had
    been threatened. The acting governor offered profuse apologies to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> for the treatment which the people of <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark> had accorded Him. “But for the
    interposition of Providence,” he said, “no force would have achieved your deliverance from the grasp of this malevolent people. But for the efficacy of the
    vow which I had made to risk my own life for your sake, I, too, would have fallen a victim to their violence, and would have been trampled beneath their
    feet.” He bitterly complained of the outrageous conduct of the siyyids of <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark>, and denounced the baseness of their character. He expressed himself as
    being continually tormented by the effects of their malignant designs. He set about serving <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> with devotion and kindness, and was often heard, in
    the course of his conversation with Him, to remark: “I am far from regarding you a prisoner in my home. This house, I believe, was built for the very
    purpose of affording you a shelter from the designs of your foes.” <a name="Page_375"></a>I have heard <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> Himself recount the following: “No prisoner has ever been accorded the treatment which I received at the hands of the acting
    governor of <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark>. He treated Me with the utmost consideration and esteem. I was generously entertained by him, and the fullest attention was given to
    everything that affected My security and comfort. I was, however, unable to leave the gate of the house. My host was afraid lest the governor, who was
    related to <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Laríjání</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Láríjání</mark>, might return from the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> and inflict injury upon Me. I tried to dispel his apprehensions. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark>
    same Omnipotence,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I assured him, <mark class="term unknown">‘who</mark> has delivered us from the hands of the <mark class="term unknown">mischief-makers</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark>, and has enabled us to be received with such
    hospitality by you in this house, is able to change the heart of the governor and to cause him to treat us with no less consideration and love.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“One night we were suddenly awakened by the clamour of the people who had gathered outside the gate of the house. The door was opened, and it was announced
    that the governor had returned to <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark>. Our companions, who were anticipating a fresh attack upon them, were completely surprised to hear the voice of the
    governor rebuking those who had denounced us so bitterly on the day of our arrival. <mark class="term unknown">‘For</mark> what reason,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> we heard him loudly remonstrating, <mark class="term unknown">‘have</mark> these
    miserable wretches chosen to treat so disrespectfully a guest whose hands are tied and who has not been given the chance to defend himself? What is their
    justification for having demanded that he be immediately put to death? What evidence have they with which to support their contention? If they be sincere
    in their claims to be devotedly attached to <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> and to be the guardians of its interests, let them betake themselves to the fort of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark>
    <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> and there demonstrate their capacity to defend the Faith of which they profess to be the champions.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
</p><p>What he had seen of the heroism of the defenders of the fort had quite changed the mind and heart of the governor of <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark>. He returned filled with
    admiration for a Cause which he had formerly despised, and the progress of which he had strenuously resisted. The scenes he witnessed had disarmed his
    wrath and chastened his pride. Humbly and <a name="Page_376"></a>respectfully, he went to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and apologised for the insolence of the inhabitants
    of a town that he had been chosen to govern. He served Him with extreme devotion, utterly ignoring his own position and rank. He paid a glowing tribute to
    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and expatiated upon his resourcefulness, his intrepidity, his skill, and nobleness of soul. A few days later, he succeeded in arranging for
    the safe departure of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and His companions for <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>.
</p><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s intention to throw in His lot with the defenders of the fort of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> was destined to remain unfulfilled. Though
    Himself extremely desirous to lend every possible assistance in His power to the besieged, He was spared, through the mysterious dispensation of
    Providence, the tragic fate that was soon to befall the chief participators in that memorable struggle. Had He been able to reach the fort, had He been
    allowed to join the members of that heroic band, how could He have played His part in the great drama which He was destined to unfold? How could He have
    consummated the work that had been so gloriously conceived and so marvellously inaugurated? He was in the heyday of His life when the call from <u>Sh</u><mark class="term unknown">íráz</mark> reached Him. At the age of <mark class="term unknown">twenty-seven</mark>, He arose to consecrate His life to its service, fearlessly identified Himself with its teachings, and
    distinguished Himself by the exemplary part He played in its diffusion. No effort was too great for the energy with which He was endowed, and no sacrifice
    too woeful for the devotion with which His faith had inspired Him. He flung aside every consideration of fame, of wealth, and position, for the prosecution
    of the task He had set His heart to achieve. Neither the taunts of His friends nor the threats of His enemies could induce Him to cease championing a Cause
    which they alike regarded as that of an obscure and proscribed sect.
<p></p>The first incarceration to which He was subjected as a result of the helping hand He had extended to the captives of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>; the ability with which He
    achieved the deliverance of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>; the exemplary manner in which He steered the course of the turbulent proceedings in <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark>; the manner in
    which He saved the life of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Níyálá</mark>; the wisdom which He showed in His handling of the delicate situation created by the impetuosity of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>,
    and the vigilance He <a name="Page_377"></a>exercised for her protection; the counsels which He gave to the defenders of the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>; the plan He
    conceived of joining the forces of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> to those of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and his companions; the spontaneity with which He arose to support the exertions of
    those brave defenders; the magnanimity which prompted Him to offer Himself as a substitute for His companions who were under the threat of severe
    indignities; the serenity with which He faced the severity inflicted upon Him as a result of the attempt on the life of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>; the
    indignities which were heaped upon Him all the way from <mark class="term unknown">Lavásán</mark> to the headquarters of the imperial army and from thence to the capital; the galling weight
    of chains which He bore as He lay in the darkness of the <mark class="term correct">Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>—all these are but a few instances that eloquently testify to the
    unique position which He occupied as the prime Mover of the forces which were destined to reshape the face of His native land. It was He who had released
    these forces, who steered their course, harmonised their action, and brought them finally to their highest consummation in the Cause He Himself was
    destined at a later time to reveal. <a name="Page_378"></a>CHAPTER XX: THE <mark class="term correct">MÁZINDARÁN</mark> UPHEAVAL (Continued)THE forces under the command of Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> meanwhile had recovered from the state of utter demoralisation into which they had sunk, and were
    now diligently preparing to renew their attack upon the occupants of the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. The latter found themselves again encompassed by a numerous host,
    at the head of which marched <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Laríjání</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Láríjání</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark><mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Af<u>sh</u>ar-i-<u>Sh</u>ahríyárí</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Af<u>sh</u>ár-i-<u>Sh</u>ahríyárí</mark>, who, together with several
regiments of infantry and cavalry, had hastened to reinforce the company of the prince’s soldiers.<a href="#_ftn374" name="_ftnref374" title="">[††††††††††††††]</a> Their combined forces encamped in the neighbourhood of the fort,    <a href="#_ftn375" name="_ftnref375" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> and proceeded to erect a series of seven barricades around it. With the utmost
    arrogance, they sought at first to display the extent of the forces at their command, and indulged with increasing zest in the daily exercise of their
    arms. <a name="Page_379"></a>The scarcity of water had, in the meantime, compelled those who were besieged to dig a well within the enclosure of the fort. On the day the work was to be
    completed, the eighth day of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’l-Avval</mark><mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’l-Avval</mark>,<a href="#_ftn376" name="_ftnref376" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who was watching
    his companions perform this task, remarked: “<mark class="term unknown">To-day</mark> we shall have all the water we require for our bath. Cleansed of all earthly defilements, we shall seek
    the court of the Almighty, and shall hasten to our eternal abode. Whoso is willing to partake of the cup of martyrdom, let him prepare himself and wait for
    the hour when he can seal with his <mark class="term unknown">life-blood</mark> his faith in his Cause. This night, ere the hour of dawn, let those who wish to join me be ready to issue
    forth from behind these walls and, scattering once again the dark forces which have beset our path, ascend untrammelled to the heights of glory.”
<p></p><p>That same afternoon, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> performed his ablutions, clothed himself in new garments, attired his head with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s turban, and prepared for the
    approaching encounter. An undefinable joy illumined his face. He serenely alluded to the hour of his departure, and continued to his last moments to
    animate the zeal of his companions. Alone with <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, who so powerfully reminded him of his Beloved, he poured forth, as he sat at his feet in the closing
    moments of his earthly life, all that an enraptured soul could no longer restrain. Soon after midnight, as soon as the <mark class="term unknown">morning-star</mark> had risen, the star
    that heralded to him the dawning light of eternal reunion with his Beloved, he started to his feet and, mounting his charger, gave the signal that the gate
of the fort be opened. As he rode out at the head of three hundred and thirteen of his companions to meet the enemy, the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!”    <a href="#_ftn377" name="_ftnref377" title="">[***************]</a> again broke forth, a cry so intense and powerful that forest, fort, and camp vibrated
    to its resounding echo.
</p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> first charged the barricade which was defended by <mark class="term misspelled">Zakariyyay-i-Qádí-Kalá’í</mark><mark class="term correction">Zakaríyyáy-i-Qádí-Kalá’í</mark>, one of the enemy’s most valiant officers. Within a short space of
    time, he had broken <a name="Page_380"></a>through that barrier, disposed of its commander, and scattered his men. Dashing forward with the same swiftness
    and intrepidity, he overcame the resistance of both the second and third barricades, diffusing, as he advanced, despair and consternation among his foes.
    Undeterred by the bullets which rained continually upon him and his companions, they pressed forward until the remaining barricades had all been captured
    and overthrown. In the midst of the tumult which ensued, <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Laríjání</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Láríjání</mark> had climbed a tree, and, hiding himself in its branches, lay
    waiting in ambush for his opponents. Protected by the darkness which surrounded him, he was able to follow from his hiding place the movements of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and his companions, who were exposed to the fierce glare of the conflagration which they had raised. The steed of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> suddenly became
    entangled in the rope of an adjoining tent, and ere he was able to extricate himself, he was struck in the breast by a bullet from his treacherous
    assailant. Though the shot was successful, <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was unaware of the identity of the horseman he had wounded. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who was
    bleeding profusely, dismounted from his horse, staggered a few steps, and, unable to proceed further, fell exhausted upon the ground. Two of his young
companions, of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Qulí</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, came to his rescue and bore him to the fort.    <a href="#_ftn378" name="_ftnref378" title="">[†††††††††††††††]</a><a name="Page_381"></a>I have heard the following account from <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-Furú<u>gh</u>í</mark>: “We were among those who had remained in the fort with
    <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>. As soon as <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who seemed to have lost consciousness, was brought in, we were ordered to retire. <mark class="term unknown">‘Leave</mark> me alone with him,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> were the
    words of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> as he bade <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> close the door and refuse admittance to anyone desiring to see him. <mark class="term unknown">‘There</mark> are certain confidential matters
    which I desire him alone to know.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> We were amazed a few moments later when we heard the voice of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> replying to questions from <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>. For two
    hours they continued to converse with each other. We were surprised to see <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> so greatly agitated. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> was watching <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he
    subsequently informed us, <mark class="term unknown">‘through</mark> a fissure in the door. As soon as he called his name, I saw <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> arise and seat himself, in his customary
    manner, on bended knees beside him. With bowed head and downcast eyes, he listened to every word that fell from the lips of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, and answered his
    questions. “You have hastened the hour of your departure,” I was able to hear <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> remark, “and have abandoned me to the mercy of my foes. Please God, I
    will ere long join you and taste the sweetness of heaven’s ineffable delights.” I was able to gather the following words uttered by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>: “May my

    regarding the spot which served as his resting place, and to conceal it even from their companions. He afterwards instructed them to inter the bodies of
    the <mark class="term unknown">thirty-six</mark> martyrs who had fallen in the course of that engagement in one and the same grave on the northern side of the shrine of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark>

</p><p>No less than ninety of the companions were wounded that night, most of whom succumbed. From the day of their arrival at <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark> <mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> to the day they
were first attacked, which fell on the twelfth of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Dh</u>i’l-Qádih</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Dh</u>i’l-Qa‘dih</mark> in the year 1264 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn380" name="_ftnref380" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> to the day of the death of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, which took place at the hour of dawn on the
    ninth of <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’l-Avval</mark> <mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’l-Avval</mark> in the year 1265 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn381" name="_ftnref381" title="">[****************]</a> the number of martyrs, according to the
    computation of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark>, had reached a total of <mark class="term unknown">seventy-two</mark>.
</p>From the time when <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was assailed by his enemies to the time of his martyrdom was a hundred and sixteen days, a period rendered memorable by
    deeds so heroic that even his bitterest foes felt bound to confess their wonder. On four distinct occasions, he rose to such heights of courage and power
as few indeed could attain. The first encounter took place on the twelfth of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Dh</u>i’l-Qádih</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Dh</u>i’l-Qa‘dih</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn382" name="_ftnref382" title="">[††††††††††††††††]</a> in the outskirts of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>; the second, in the immediate neighbourhood of
    the fort of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, on the fifth day of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark>,<a href="#_ftn383" name="_ftnref383" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a>
against the forces of <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’lláh</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Turkamán</mark>; the third, in <mark class="term misspelled">Vas-Kas</mark><mark class="term correction">Vás-Kas</mark>, on the <mark class="term unknown">twenty-fifth</mark> day of <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn384" name="_ftnref384" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> directed against the army of Prince <a name="Page_383"></a><mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>. The last
    and most memorable battle of all was directed against the combined forces of <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, of Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, and of <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark><u>Kh</u><mark class="term unknown">án-i-Af<u>sh</u>ar</mark>, assisted by a company of <mark class="term unknown">forty-five</mark> officers of tried ability and matured experience. From each of these hot and fierce engagements
    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> emerged, in spite of the overwhelming forces arrayed against him, unscathed and triumphant. In each encounter he distinguished himself by such
    acts of valour, of chivalry, of skill, and of strength that each one would alone suffice to establish for all time the transcendent character of a Faith
    for the protection of which he had so valiantly fought, and in the path of which he had so nobly died. The traits of mind and of character which, from his
    very youth, he displayed, the profundity of his learning, the tenacity of his faith, his intrepid courage, his singleness of purpose, his high sense of
    justice and unswerving devotion, marked him as an outstanding figure among those who, by their lives, have borne witness to the glory and power of the new
    Revelation. He was six and thirty years old when he quaffed the cup of martyrdom. At the age of eighteen he made the acquaintance, in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark>. For nine years he sat at his feet, and imbibed the lesson which was destined to prepare him for the acceptance of the Message of the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. The nine remaining years of his life were spent in the midst of a restless, a feverish activity which carried him eventually to the field of
martyrdom, in circumstances that have shed imperishable lustre upon his country’s history.    <a href="#_ftn385" name="_ftnref385" title="">[*****************]</a><a name="Page_384"></a>So complete and humiliating a rout paralysed for a time the efforts of the enemy. Five and forty days passed before they could again reassemble their
    forces and renew their attack. During these intervening days, which ended with the day of <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, the intense cold which prevailed induced them to defer
    their venture against an opponent that had covered them with so much reproach and shame. Though their attacks had been suspended, the officers in charge of
    the remnants of the imperial army had given strict orders prohibiting the arrival of all manner of reinforcements at the fort. When the supply of their
    provisions was nearly exhausted, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> instructed <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> to distribute among his companions the rice which <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had stored for such
    time as might be required. When each had received his portion, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> summoned them and said: “Whoever feels himself strong enough to withstand the
    calamities that are soon to befall us, let him remain with us in this fort. And whoever perceives in himself the least hesitation and fear, let him betake
    himself away from this place. Let him leave immediately ere the enemy has again assembled his forces and assailed us. The way will soon be barred before
    our face; we shall very soon encounter the severest hardship and fall a victim to devastating afflictions.”
<p></p><p>The very night <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> had given this warning, a siyyid from <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Mutavallí</mark>, was moved to betray his companions. “Why is it,” he wrote to
    <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Laríjání</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Láríjání</mark>, “that you have left unfinished the work <a name="Page_385"></a>which you have begun? You have already disposed of a
    formidable opponent. By the removal of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who was the moving force behind these walls, you have demolished the pillar on which the strength and
    security of the fort depend. Had you been patient for one more day, you would have assuredly won for yourself the laurels of victory. With no more than a
    hundred men, I pledge my word that within the space of two days you will be able to capture the fort and secure the unconditional surrender of its
    occupants. They are worn with famine and are being grievously tested.” The sealed letter was entrusted to a certain <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alíy-i-Zargar</mark>, who, as he
    carried with him the share of the rice he had received from <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, stole out of the fort at the hour of midnight and delivered it to <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark> <u>Kh</u>
<mark class="term unknown">án</mark>, with whom he was already acquainted. The message reached him at a time when he had sought refuge in a village situated at a distance of four <mark class="term correct">farsangs</mark>    <a href="#_ftn386" name="_ftnref386" title="">[†††††††††††††††††]</a> from the fort, and knew not whether he should return to the capital and present
    himself after such a humiliating defeat to his sovereign, or repair to his home in <mark class="term unknown">Laríján</mark>, where he was sure to face the reproaches of his relations and
    friends.
</p>He had just risen from his bed when, at the hour of sunrise, the siyyid brought him the letter. The news of the death of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> nerved him to a fresh
    resolve. Fearing <a name="Page_386"></a>lest the messenger should spread the report concerning the death of so redoubtable an opponent, he instantly killed
    him, and then contrived by some strange device to divert from himself the suspicion of murder. Resolved to take the fullest advantage of the distress of
    the besieged and of the depletion of their forces, he undertook immediately the necessary preparations for the resumption of his attacks. Ten days before
    <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, he had encamped at half a <mark class="term correct">farsang</mark> from the fort, and had ascertained the accuracy of the message that treacherous siyyid had brought him. In the
    hope of obtaining for himself every possible credit for the eventual surrender of his opponents, he refused to divulge, to even his closest officers, the
    information he had received.
<p></p>The day had just broken when he hoisted his standard<a href="#_ftn387" name="_ftnref387" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> and, marching at the head of two
    regiments of infantry and cavalry, encompassed the fort and ordered his men to open fire upon the sentinels who were guarding the turrets. “The betrayer,”
    <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> informed <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark>, who had hastened to acquaint him with the gravity of the situation, “has announced the death of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> to
    <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. Emboldened by his removal, he is now determined to storm our stronghold and to secure for himself the honour of being its sole
    conqueror. Sally out and, with the aid of eighteen men marching at your side, administer a befitting chastisement upon the aggressor and his host. Let him
    realise that though <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> be no more, God’s <a name="Page_387"></a>invincible power still continues to sustain his companions and enable them to
    triumph over the forces of their enemies.”
<p></p><p>No sooner had <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> selected his companions than he ordered that the gate of the fort be flung open. Leaping upon their chargers and raising
    the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!” they plunged headlong into the camp of the enemy. The whole army fled in confusion before so terrific a charge. All but a
    few were able to escape. They reached <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark> <mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> utterly demoralised and laden with shame. <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was so shaken with fear that he
    fell from his horse. Leaving, in his distress, one of his boots hanging from the stirrup, he ran away, half shod and bewildered, in the direction which the
army had taken. Filled with despair, he hastened to the prince and confessed the ignominious reverse he had sustained.    <a href="#_ftn388" name="_ftnref388" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark>, on his part, emerging together with his eighteen companions
    unscathed from that encounter, and holding in his hand the <a name="Page_388"></a>standard which an affrighted enemy had abandoned, repaired with
    exultation to the fort and submitted to his chief, who had inspired him with such courage, this evidence of his victory.
</p>So complete a rout immediately brought relief to the <mark class="term unknown">hard-pressed</mark> companions. It cemented their unity and reminded them afresh of the efficacy of that
    power with which their Faith had endowed them. Their food, alas, was by this time reduced to the flesh of horses, which they had brought away with them
    from the deserted camp of the enemy. With steadfast fortitude they endured the afflictions which beset them from every side. Their hearts were set on the
    wishes of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>; all else mattered but little. Neither the severity of their distress nor the continual threats of the enemy could cause them to deviate a
    hairbreadth from the path which their departed companions had so heroically trodden. A few were found who subsequently faltered in the darkest hour of
    adversity. The <mark class="term unknown">faint-heartedness</mark> which this negligible element was compelled to betray paled, however, into insignificance before the radiance which the
    mass of their stouthearted companions shed in the hour of realised doom. <a name="Page_389"></a>Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, who was stationed in <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark><mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark>, welcomed with keen delight the news of the defeat that had overtaken the forces under the immediate
    command of his colleague <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. Though himself desirous of extirpating the band that had sought shelter behind the walls of the fort, he
rejoiced at the knowledge that his rival had failed to secure the victory which he coveted.    <a href="#_ftn389" name="_ftnref389" title="">[******************]</a> He wrote immediately to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and demanded that reinforcements in the form of
    <mark class="term unknown">bomb-shells</mark> and <mark class="term unknown">camel-artillery</mark>, with all the necessary equipments, be despatched without delay to the neighbourhood of the fort, he being determined, this
    time, to effect the complete subjugation of its obstinate occupants.
<p></p>Whilst their enemies were preparing for yet another and still fiercer attack upon their stronghold, the companions of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, utterly indifferent to the
    gnawing distress that afflicted them, acclaimed with joy and gratitude the approach of <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>. In the course of that festival, they gave free vent to
    their feelings of thanksgiving and praise in return for the manifold blessings which the Almighty had bestowed upon them. Though oppressed with hunger,
    they indulged in songs and merriment, utterly disdaining the danger with which they were beset. The fort resounded with the ascriptions of glory and praise
    which, both in the daytime and in the <mark class="term unknown">night-season</mark>, ascended from the hearts of that joyous band. The verse, “Holy, holy, the Lord our God, the Lord of the
    angels and the spirit,” issued unceasingly from their lips, heightened their enthusiasm, and reanimated their courage.
<p></p>All that remained of the cattle they had brought with them to the fort was a cow which <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Nasiru’d-Dín-i-Qazvíní</mark><mark class="term correction">Naṣíru’d-Dín-i-Qazvíní</mark> had set aside, and the milk of which he
    made into a pudding every day for the table of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>. Unwilling to <a name="Page_390"></a>deny his <mark class="term unknown">hunger-stricken</mark> friends their share of the delicacy
    which his devoted companion prepared for him, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> would, after partaking of a few teaspoonfuls of that dish, invariably distribute the rest among them.
    “I have ceased to enjoy,” he was often heard to remark, “since the departure of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, the meat and drink which they prepare for me. My heart bleeds
    at the sight of my famished companions, worn and wasted around me.” Despite these adverse circumstances, he unfailingly continued further to elucidate in
    his commentary the significance of the <mark class="term correct">Sád</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Samad</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣamad</mark>, and to exhort his friends to persevere till the vary end in their heroic endeavours. At morn and at
    eventide, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> would chant, in the presence of the assembled believers, verses from that commentary, the reading of which would quicken
    their enthusiasm and brighten their hopes.
<p></p>I have heard <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-Furú<u>gh</u>í</mark> testify to the following: “God knows that we had ceased to hunger for food. Our thoughts were no longer
    concerned with matters pertaining to our daily bread. We were so enraptured by the entrancing melody of those verses that, were we to have continued for
    years in that state, no trace of weariness and fatigue could possibly have dimmed our enthusiasm or marred our gladness. And whenever the lack of
    nourishment would tend to sap our vitality and weaken our strength, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> would hasten to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and acquaint him with our plight. A glimpse
    of his face, the magic of his words, as he walked amongst us, would transmute our despondency into golden joy. We were reinforced with a strength of such
    intensity that, had the hosts of our enemies appeared suddenly before us, we felt ourselves capable of subjugating their forces.”
<p></p><p>On the day of <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, which fell on the <mark class="term unknown">twenty-fourth</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark> in the year 1265 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn390" name="_ftnref390" title="">[††††††††††††††††††]</a> <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> alluded, in a written message to his companions, to the approach of such
trials as would bring in their wake the martyrdom of a considerable number of his friends. A few days later, an innumerable host,<a href="#_ftn391" name="_ftnref391" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> commanded by Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark> <a name="Page_391"></a><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>    <a href="#_ftn392" name="_ftnref392" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> and seconded by the joint forces of <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark> <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Af<u>sh</u>ar</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Af<u>sh</u>ár</mark>, of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Laríjání</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Láríjání</mark>, and of <mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ja‘far-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, assisted by about forty other officers, encamped in the neighbourhood of the fort, and
set about constructing a series of trenches and barricades in its immediate vicinity.<a href="#_ftn393" name="_ftnref393" title="">[*******************]</a> On the ninth day of the month of <mark class="term correct">Bahá</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn394" name="_ftnref394" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††]</a> the commanding officer gave orders to those in charge of his artillery to open fire
    in the direction of the besieged. While the bombardment was in progress, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> emerged from his room and walked to the centre of the fort. His face was
    wreathed in smiles, and his demeanour breathed forth the utmost tranquillity. As he was pacing the floor, a <mark class="term unknown">cannon-ball</mark> fell suddenly before him. “How
    utterly unaware,” he calmly remarked, as he rolled it with his foot, “are these boastful aggressors of the power of God’s avenging wrath! Have they
    forgotten that a creature as insignificant as the gnat was capable of extinguishing <a name="Page_392"></a>the life of the <mark class="term unknown">all-powerful</mark> Nimrod? Have they
    not heard that the roaring of the tempest was sufficient to destroy the people of <mark class="term correct">‘Ád</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Th</u>ámúd</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Th</u>amúd</mark> and to annihilate their forces? Seek they to
    intimidate the heroes of God, in whose sight the pomp of royalty is but an empty shadow, with such contemptible evidences of their cruelty?” “You are,” he
    added, as he turned to his friends, “those same companions of whom <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, the Apostle of God, has thus spoken: <mark class="term unknown">‘Oh</mark>, how I long to behold the countenance
    of my brethren; my brethren who will appear in the end of the world! Blessed are we, blessed are they; greater is their blessedness than ours.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Beware lest
    you allow the encroachments of self and desire to impair so glorious a station. Fear not the threats of the wicked, neither be dismayed by the clamour of
    the ungodly. Each one of you has his appointed hour, and when that time is come, neither the assaults of your enemy nor the endeavours of your friends will
    be able either to retard or to advance that hour. If the powers of the earth league themselves against you, they will be powerless, ere that hour strikes,
    to lessen by one jot or tittle the span of your life. Should you allow your hearts to be agitated for but one moment by the booming of these guns which,
    with increasing violence, will continue to shower their shot upon this fort, you will have cast yourselves out of the stronghold of Divine protection.”
</p><p>So powerful an appeal could not fail to breathe confidence into the hearts of those who heard it. A few, however, whose countenances betrayed vacillation
and fear, were seen huddled together in a sheltered corner of the fort, viewing with envy and surprise the zeal that animated their companions.    <a href="#_ftn395" name="_ftnref395" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> <a name="Page_393"></a>The army of Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> continued for a few days to fire in the direction of the fort. His men were surprised to find that the booming of their
    guns had failed to silence the voice of prayer and the acclamations of joy which the besieged raised in answer to their threats. Instead of the
    unconditional surrender which they expected, the call of the <mark class="term misspelled">mua<u>dhdh</u>ín</mark> <mark class="term correction">mua<u>dh</u><u>dh</u>in</mark>,<a href="#_ftn396" name="_ftnref396" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> the
    chanting of the verses of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, and the chorus of gladsome voices intoning hymns of thanksgiving and praise reached their ears without ceasing.
</p>Exasperated by these evidences of unquenchable fervour and impelled by a burning desire to extinguish the enthusiasm which swelled within the breasts of
his opponents, <mark class="term unknown">Ja’far-qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> erected a tower, upon which he stationed his cannon,    <a href="#_ftn397" name="_ftnref397" title="">[********************]</a> and from that eminence directed his fire into the heart of the fort. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>
    immediately summoned <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> and instructed him to sally again and inflict upon the “boastful newcomer” a humiliation no less crushing than
    the one which <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> had suffered. <a name="Page_394"></a>“Let him know,” he added, “that God’s <mark class="term unknown">lion-hearted</mark> warriors, when pressed and
    driven by hunger, are able to manifest deeds of such heroism as no ordinary mortals can show. Let him know that the greater their hunger, the more
    devastating shall be the effects of their exasperation.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> again ordered eighteen of his companions to hurry to their steeds and follow him. The gates of the fort were thrown open, and the cry
    of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!”—fiercer and more thrilling than ever—diffused panic and consternation in the ranks of the enemy. <mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ja‘far-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, with
    thirty of his men, fell before the sword of their adversary, who rushed to the tower, captured the guns, and hurled them to the ground. Thence they threw
    themselves upon the barricade which had been erected, demolished a number of them, and would, but for the approaching darkness, have captured and destroyed
    the rest.
</p>Triumphant and unhurt, they repaired to the fort, carrying back with them a number of the stoutest and <mark class="term unknown">best-fed</mark> stallions which had been left behind. A few
    days elapsed during which there was no sign of a <mark class="term unknown">counter-attack</mark>.<a href="#_ftn398" name="_ftnref398" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††]</a> A sudden explosion
    in one of the ammunition stores of the enemy, which had caused the death of several artillery officers and a number of their <mark class="term unknown">fellow-combatants</mark>, forced them
    for one whole month to suspend their attacks upon the garrison.<a href="#_ftn399" name="_ftnref399" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> This lull enabled a
number of the companions to emerge occasionally from their stronghold and gather such grass as they could find in the field as the only means wherewith to    <a name="Page_395"></a>allay their hunger. The flesh of horses, even the leather of their saddles, had been consumed by these <mark class="term unknown">hard-pressed</mark> companions. They
    boiled the grass and devoured it with piteous avidity.<a href="#_ftn400" name="_ftnref400" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> As their strength declined,
    as they languished exhausted within the walls of their fort, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> multiplied his visits to them, and endeavoured by his words of cheer and of hope to
    lighten the load of their agony.
<p></p>The month of <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádiyu’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark><mark class="term correction">Jamádíyu’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark><a href="#_ftn401" name="_ftnref401" title="">[*********************]</a> had just begun when the artillery of
    the enemy was heard again discharging its showers of balls upon the fort. Simultaneously with the booming of the cannons, a detachment of the army, headed
    by a number of officers and consisting of several regiments of infantry and cavalry, rushed to storm it. The sound of their approach impelled <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> to
summon promptly his valiant lieutenant, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark>, and to bid him emerge with <mark class="term unknown">thirty-six</mark> of his companions and repulse their attack.    <a name="Page_396"></a>“Never since our occupation of this fort,” he added, “have we under any circumstances attempted to direct any offensive against our
    opponents. Not until they unchained their attack upon us did we arise to defend our lives. Had we cherished the ambition of waging holy war against them,
    had we harboured the least intention of achieving ascendancy through the power of our arms over the unbelievers, we should not, until this day, have
    remained besieged within these walls. The force of our arms would have by now, as was the case with the companions of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> in days past, convulsed the
    nations of the earth and prepared them for the acceptance of our Message. Such is not the way, however, which we have chosen to tread. Ever since we
    repaired to this fort, our sole, our unalterable purpose has been the vindication, by our deeds and by our readiness to shed our blood in the path of our
    Faith, of the exalted character of our mission. The hour is fast approaching when we shall be able to consummate this task.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> once more leaped on horseback and, with the <mark class="term unknown">thirty-six</mark> companions whom he had selected, confronted and scattered the forces which had
    beset him. He carried with him, as he <mark class="term unknown">re-entered</mark> the gate, the banner which an alarmed enemy had abandoned as soon as the reverberating cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark>
    <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!” had been raised. Five of his companions suffered martyrdom in the course of that engagement, all of whom he bore to the fort and interred
    in one tomb close to the resting place of their fallen brethren.
</p>Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, astounded by this further evidence of the inexhaustible vitality of his opponents, took counsel with the chiefs of his staff,
    urging them to devise such means as would enable him to bring that costly enterprise to a speedy end. For three days he deliberated with them, and finally
    came to the conclusion that the most advisable course to take would be to suspend all manner of hostilities for a few days in the hope that the besieged,
    exhausted with hunger and goaded by despair, would decide to emerge from their retreat and submit to an unconditional surrender.
<p></p>As the prince was waiting for the consummation of the plan he had conceived, there arrived from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> a messenger <a name="Page_397"></a>bearing to him
    the <mark class="term correct">farmán</mark><a href="#_ftn402" name="_ftnref402" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††]</a> of his sovereign. This man was a resident of the village of <mark class="term correct">Kand</mark>, a
    place not far from the capital. He succeeded in obtaining leave from the prince to enter the fort and attempt to induce two of its occupants, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark>
    and his brother <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Báqir-i-Kandí</mark>, to escape from the imminent danger to which their lives were exposed. As he approached its walls, he called the
    sentinels and asked them to inform <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Mihdiy-Kandí</mark> that an acquaintance of his desired to see him. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark> reported the matter to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, who
    permitted him to meet his friend.
<p></p>I have heard <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark> give the following account, as related to him by that same messenger whom he met in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>: “<mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> saw,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> the messenger informed me,
    <mark class="term misspelled">‘Mullá</mark><mark class="term correction">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark> appear above the wall of the fort, his countenance revealing an expression of stern resolve that baffled description. He looked as fierce as a
    lion, his sword was girded on over a long white shirt after the manner of the Arabs, and he had a white kerchief around his head. “What is it that you
    seek?” he impatiently enquired. “Say it quickly, for I fear that my master will summon me and find me absent.” The determination that glowed in his eyes
    confused me. I was dumbfounded at his looks and manner. The thought suddenly flashed through my mind that I would awaken a dormant sentiment in his heart.
    I reminded him of his infant child, <mark class="term misspelled">Rahmán</mark><mark class="term correction">Raḥmán</mark>, whom he had left behind in the village, in his eagerness to enlist under the standard of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. In his
    great affection for the child, he had specially composed a poem which he chanted as he rocked his cradle and lulled him to sleep. “Your beloved <mark class="term misspelled">Rahmán</mark><mark class="term correction">Raḥmán</mark>,” I
    said, “longs for the affection which you once lavished upon him. He is alone and forsaken, and yearns to see you.” “Tell him from me,” was the father’s
    instant reply, “that the love of the true <mark class="term misspelled">Rahmán</mark><mark class="term correction">Raḥmán</mark>,<a href="#_ftn403" name="_ftnref403" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> a love that transcends all
    earthly affections, has so filled my heart that it has left no place for any other it love besides His.” The poignancy with which he uttered these words
    brought tears to my eyes. “Accursed,” I indignantly exclaimed, “be those who consider you and your <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> as having strayed from the path of
    God!” <a name="Page_398"></a>“What,” I asked him, “if I venture to enter the fort and join you?” “If your motive be to seek and find the Truth,” he calmly
    replied, “I will gladly show you the way. And if you seek to visit me as an old and lifelong friend, I will accord you the welcome of which the Prophet of
    God has spoken: <mark class="term unknown">‘Welcome</mark> your guests though they be of the infidels.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I will, faithful to that injunction, offer you the boiled grass and the churned bones
    which serve as my meat, the best I can procure for you. But if your intention be to harm me, I warn you that I will defend myself and will hurl you from
    the heights of these walls to the ground.” His unswerving obstinacy convinced me of the futility of my efforts. I could feel that he was fired with such
    enthusiasm that, were the divines of the realm to assemble and endeavour to dissuade him from the course he had chosen to pursue, he would, alone and
    unaided, baffle their efforts. Neither, was I convinced, could all the potentates of the earth succeed in luring him away from the Beloved of his heart’s
    desire. “May the cup,” I was moved to say, “which your lips have tasted, bring you all the blessings you seek.” “The prince,” I added, “has vowed that
    whoever steps out of this fort will be secure from danger, that he will even receive a safe passage from him, as well as whatever expenses he may require
    for the journey to his home.” He promised to convey the prince’s message to his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-companions</mark>. “Is there anything further you wish to tell me?” he
    added. “I am impatient to join my master.” “May God,” I replied, “assist you in accomplishing your purpose.” “He has indeed assisted me!” he burst forth in
    exultation. “How else could I have been delivered from the darkness of my <mark class="term unknown">prison-home</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Kand</mark>? How could I have reached this exalted stronghold?” No sooner
    had he uttered these words than, turning his face away from me, he vanished from my sight.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p>As soon as he had joined his companions, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark> conveyed the prince’s message to them. On the afternoon of that same day, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Mutavallí</mark>, accompanied by his servant, left the fort and went directly to join the prince in his camp. The next day, <mark class="term misspelled">Rasul-i-Bahnimírí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Rasúl-i-Bahnimírí</mark> and a few
    other of his companions, unable to resist the ravages of famine, and encouraged by the explicit assurances <a name="Page_399"></a>or the prince, sadly and
    reluctantly separated themselves from their friends. No sooner had they stepped out of the fort than they were all instantly slain at the order of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Laríjání</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Láríjání</mark>.
</p>During the few days that elapsed after that incident, the enemy, still encamped in the neighbourhood of the fort, refrained from any act of hostility
towards <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and his companions. On Wednesday morning, the sixteenth of <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádiyu’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark><mark class="term correction">Jamádíyu’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn404" name="_ftnref404" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> an emissary of the prince arrived at the fort and requested that two
    representatives be delegated by the besieged to conduct confidential negotiations with them in the hope of arriving at a peaceful settlement of the issues
    outstanding between them.<a href="#_ftn405" name="_ftnref405" title="">[**********************]</a>Accordingly, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> instructed <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Yúsúf-i-Ardibílí</mark><mark class="term correction">Yúsuf-i-Ardibílí</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Riḍáy-i-<u>Kh</u>urásání</mark> to act as his representatives, and bade them inform the prince of
    his readiness to accede to his wish. <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> courteously received them, and invited them to partake of the tea which he had prepared. “We should,”
    they said, as they declined his offer, “feel it to be an act of disloyalty on our part were we to partake of either meat or drink whilst our beloved leader
    languishes worn and famished in the fort.” “The hostilities between us,” the prince remarked, “have been unduly prolonged. We, on both sides, have fought
    long and suffered grievously. It is my fervent wish to achieve an amicable settlement of our differences.” He took hold of a copy of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> that lay
    beside him, and wrote, with his own hand, in confirmation of his statement, the following words on the margin of the opening <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark>: “I swear by this most
    holy Book, by the righteousness of God who has revealed it, and the Mission of Him who was inspired with its verses, that I cherish no other purpose than
    to promote peace and friendliness between us. Come forth from your stronghold and rest assured that no hand will be stretched forth against you. You
    yourself <a name="Page_400"></a>and your companions, I solemnly declare, are under the sheltering protection of the Almighty, of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, His Prophet, and
    of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, our sovereign. I pledge my honour that no man, either in this army or in this neighbourhood, will ever attempt to assail you.
    The malediction of God, the omnipotent Avenger, rest upon me if in my heart I cherish any other desire than that which I have stated.
<p></p>He affixed his seal to his statement and, delivering the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> into the hands of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Yúsúf</mark><mark class="term correction">Yúsuf</mark>, asked him to convey his greetings to his leader and to
    present him this formal and written assurance. “I will,” he added, “in pursuance of my declaration, despatch to the gate of the fort, this very afternoon,
    a number of horses, which I trust he and his leading companions will accept and mount, in order to ride to the neighbourhood of this camp, where a special
    tent will have been pitched for their reception. I would request them to be our guests until such time as I shall be able to arrange for their return, at
    my expense, to their homes.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> received the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> from the hand of his messenger, kissed it reverently, and said: “O our Lord, decide between us and between our people with
    truth; for the best to decide art Thou.”<a href="#_ftn406" name="_ftnref406" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> Immediately after, he bade the rest of
    his companions prepare themselves to leave the fort. “By our response to their invitation,” he told them, “we shall enable them to demonstrate the
    sincerity of their intentions.”
</p><p>As the hour of their departure approached, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> attired his head with the green turban which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had sent to him at the time He sent the one that
    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> wore on the day of his martyrdom. At the gate of the fort, they mounted the horses which had been placed at their disposal, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> mounting
    the favourite steed of the prince which the latter had sent for his use. His chief companions, among whom were a number of siyyids and learned divines,
    rode behind him, and were followed by the rest, who marched on foot, carrying with them all that was left of their arms and belongings. As the company, who
were two hundred and two in number, reached the tent which the prince had ordered to be pitched for <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> in the vicinity of the public bath    <a name="Page_401"></a>of the village of Dizva, overlooking the camp of the enemy, they alighted and proceeded to occupy their lodgings in the
    neighbourhood of that tent.
</p>Soon after their arrival, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> emerged from his tent and, gathering together his companions, addressed them in these words: “You should show forth
    exemplary renunciation, for such behaviour on your part will exalt our Cause and redound to its glory. Anything short of complete detachment will but serve
    to tarnish the purity of its name and to obscure its splendour. Pray the Almighty to grant that even to your last hour He may graciously assist you to
    contribute your share to the exaltation of His Faith.”
<p></p><p>A few hours after sunset, they were served with dinner brought from the camp of the prince. The food that was offered them in separate trays, each of which
    was assigned to a group of thirty companions, was poor and scanty. “Nine of us,” those who were with <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> subsequently related, “were summoned by our
    leader to partake of the dinner which had been served in his tent. As he refused to taste it, we too, following his example, refrained from eating. The
    attendants who waited upon us were delighted to partake of the dishes which we had refused to touch, and devoured their contents with appreciation and
    avidity.” A few of the companions <a name="Page_402"></a>who were dining outside the tent were heard remonstrating with the attendants, pleading that they
    were willing to buy from them, at however exorbitant a price, the bread which they needed. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> strongly disapproved of their conduct and rebuked them
    for the request they had made. But for the intercession of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark>, he would have severely punished them for having so completely disregarded
    his earnest exhortations.
</p>At daybreak a messenger arrived, summoning <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> to the presence of the prince. With the consent of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, he responded to that invitation,
    and returned an hour later, informing his chief that the prince had, in the presence of <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark><mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Af<u>sh</u>ar</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Af<u>sh</u>ár</mark>, reiterated the assurances he
    had given, and had treated him with great consideration and kindness. “<mark class="term unknown">‘My</mark> oath,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he assured me,” <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> explained, “<mark class="term unknown">‘is</mark> irrevocable and
    sacred.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He cited the case of <mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ja‘far-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who, notwithstanding his shameless massacre of thousands of soldiers of the imperial army, in the
    course of the insurrection fomented by the <mark class="term misspelled">Salar</mark><mark class="term correction">Sálár</mark>, was pardoned by his sovereign and promptly invested with fresh honours by <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>. <mark class="term unknown">To-morrow</mark>
    the prince intends to accompany you in the morning to the public bath, from whence he will proceed to your tent, after which he will provide the horses
required to convey the entire company to <mark class="term misspelled">Sang-Sar</mark><mark class="term correction">Sang-Sár</mark>, from where they will disperse, some returning to their homes in <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, and others proceeding to    <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. At the request of <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who urged that the presence of such a large gathering at such a fortified centre as <mark class="term misspelled">Sang-Sar</mark><mark class="term correction">Sang-Sár</mark> would
    be fraught with risk, the prince decided that the party should disperse, instead, at <mark class="term correct">Fírúz-Kúh</mark>. I am of opinion that what his tongue professes, his heart
    does not believe at all.” <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, who shared his view, bade his companions disperse that very night, and stated that he himself would soon proceed to
    <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>. They hastened to implore him not to separate himself from them, and begged to be allowed to continue to enjoy the blessings of his
    companionship. He counselled them to be calm and patient, and assured them that, whatever afflictions the future might yet reveal, they would meet again.
    “Weep not,” were his parting words; “the reunion which will follow this separation <a name="Page_403"></a>will be such as shall eternally endure. We have
    committed our Cause to the care of God; whatever be His will and pleasure, the same we joyously accept.”
<p></p><p>The prince failed to redeem his promise. Instead of joining <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> in his tent, he called him, with several of his companions, to his headquarters, and
informed him, as soon as they reached the tent of the <mark class="term correct">Farrá<u>sh</u>-Bá<u>sh</u>í</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn407" name="_ftnref407" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> that he himself would summon him at noon to his presence. Shortly after, a
    number of the prince’s attendants went and told the rest of the companions that <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> permitted them to join him at the army’s headquarters. Several of
    them were deceived by this report, were made captives, and were eventually sold as slaves. These unfortunate victims constitute the remnant of the
    companions of the fort of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, who survived that heroic struggle and were spared to transmit to their countrymen the woeful tale
    of their sufferings and trials.
</p>Soon after, the prince’s attendants brought pressure to bear upon <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Yúsúf</mark><mark class="term correction">Yúsuf</mark> to inform the remainder of his companions of the desire of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> that they
    immediately disarm. “What is it that you will tell them exactly?” they asked him, as he was being conducted to a place at some distance from the army’s
    headquarters. “I will,” was the bold reply, “warn them that whatever be henceforth the nature of the message you choose to deliver to them on behalf of
    their leader, that message is naught but downright falsehood.” These words had hardly escaped his lips when he was mercilessly put to death.
<p></p>From this savage act they turned their attention to the fort, plundered it of its contents, and proceeded to bombard and demolish it completely.    <a href="#_ftn408" name="_ftnref408" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> They then immediately encompassed the remaining companions and opened fire upon
them. Any who escaped the bullets were killed by the swords of the officers and the spears of their men.    <a href="#_ftn409" name="_ftnref409" title="">[***********************]</a> In the <a name="Page_404"></a>very throes of death, these unconquerable heroes
    were still heard to utter the words, “Holy, holy, O Lord our God, Lord of the angels and the spirit,” words which in moments of exultation had fallen from
    their lips, and which they now repeated with undiminished fervour at this crowning hour of their lives.
<p></p>As soon as these atrocities hath been perpetrated, the prince ordered those who had been retained as captives to be ushered, one after another, into his
presence. Those among them who were men of recognised standing, such as the father of <mark class="term misspelled">Badí</mark><mark class="term correction">Badí‘</mark>,<a href="#_ftn410" name="_ftnref410" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††]</a><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-Furú<u>gh</u>í</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term unknown">Náṣiri’d-Qazvíní</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn411" name="_ftnref411" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> he charged his attendants to conduct to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and obtain in return for their
    deliverance a ransom from each one of them in direct proportion to their capacity and wealth. As to the rest, he gave orders to his executioners that they
    be immediately put to death. A few were cut to pieces with the sword,<a href="#_ftn412" name="_ftnref412" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> others
    were torn asunder, a number were bound to trees and riddled with bullets, and still others were blown <a name="Page_405"></a>from the mouths of cannons and
    consigned to the flames.<a href="#_ftn413" name="_ftnref413" title="">[************************]</a>This terrible butchery had hardly been concluded when three of the companions of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, who were residents of <mark class="term misspelled">Sang-Sar</mark><mark class="term correction">Sang-Sár</mark>, were ushered into the presence of
    the prince. One of them was <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, whose father, <mark class="term correct">Mír</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>, a devoted admirer of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aḥmad-i-Ahsá’í</mark><mark class="term correction">Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í</mark>, had been a man of
    great learning and distinguished merit. He, accompanied by this same <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and his brother, <mark class="term correct">Mír</mark><mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark>, who met his death the very night on
    which <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was slain, had departed for <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> in the year preceding the declaration of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, with the intention of introducing his two sons to
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. Ere his arrival, the siyyid had departed this life. He immediately determined to leave for <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark>. While in that city, the Prophet <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>
    one night appeared to him in a dream, bidding the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, the Commander of the Faithful, announce to him that after his death both his sons, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mír</mark><mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark>, would attain the presence of the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> and would each suffer martyrdom in His path. As soon as he awoke, he called for
    his son <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and acquainted him with his will and last wishes. On the seventh day after that dream he died.
<p></p>In <mark class="term misspelled">Sang-Sar</mark><mark class="term correction">Sang-Sár</mark> two other persons, <mark class="term correct">Karbilá’í</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Karbilá’í</mark><mark class="term correct">Abú-Muḥammad</mark>, both known for their piety and spiritual insight, strove to prepare the people
for the acceptance of <a name="Page_406"></a>the promised Revelation, the advent of which they felt was fast approaching. In the year 1264 A.H.    <a href="#_ftn414" name="_ftnref414" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> they publicly announced that in that very year a man named <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> would,
    preceded by a Black Standard and accompanied by a number of his chosen companions, set forth from <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> and proceed to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>. They urged
    every loyal adherent of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> to arise and lend him every possible assistance. “The standard which he will hoist,” they declared, “will be none other than
    the standard of the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>; he who will unfurl it, none other than His lieutenant and chief promoter of His Cause. Whoso follows him will be saved,
    and he who turns away will be among the fallen.” <mark class="term correct">Karbilá’í</mark><mark class="term correct">Abú-Muḥammad</mark> urged his two sons, <mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>, to arise for the triumph of the
    new Revelation and to sacrifice every material consideration for the attainment of that end. Both <mark class="term correct">Karbilá’í</mark><mark class="term correct">Abú-Muḥammad</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Karbilá’í</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> died in the
    spring of that same year.
<p></p>These two sons of <mark class="term correct">Karbilá’í</mark><mark class="term correct">Abú-Muḥammad</mark> were the two companions who had been ushered, together with <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, into the presence of the prince. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-’Abidin-i-<u>Sh</u>áhmírzádí</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín-i-<u>Sh</u>ahmírzádí</mark>, one of the trusted and learned counsellors of the government, acquainted the prince with their story and related the
    experiences and activities of their respective fathers. “For what reason,” <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> was asked, “have you chosen to tread a path that has involved you
    and your kinsmen in such circumstances of wretchedness and disgrace? Could you not have been satisfied with the vast number of erudite and illustrious
    divines who are to be found in this land and in <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>?” “My faith in this Cause,” he fearlessly retorted, “is born not of idle imitation. I have
dispassionately enquired into its precepts, and am convinced of its truth. When in <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark>, I ventured to request the preeminent <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> of that city,    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥasan-i-Najafí</mark>, to expound for me certain truths connected with the secondary principles underlying the teachings of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>.
    He refused to accede to my request. I reiterated my appeal, whereupon he angrily rebuked me and persisted in his refusal. How can I, in the light of such
    experience, be expected to seek enlightenment on the abstruse articles of the Faith <a name="Page_407"></a>of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> from a divine, however illustrious, who
    refuses to answer my question on such simple and ordinary matters and who expresses his indignation at my having put such questions to him?” “What is your
    belief concerning <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>?” asked the prince. “We believe,” he replied, “<mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> to have been the bearer of the standard of which <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>
    has spoken: <mark class="term unknown">‘Should</mark> your eyes behold the Black Standards proceeding from <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, hasten ye towards them, even though ye should have to crawl over
    the snow.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> For this reason we have renounced the world and have flocked to his standard, a standard which is but a symbol of our Faith. If you wish to
    bestow upon me a favour, bid your executioner put an end to me and enable me to be gathered to the company of my immortal companions. For the world and all
    its charms have ceased to allure me. I long to depart this life and return to my God.” The prince, who was reluctant to take the life of a siyyid, refused
    to order his execution. His two companions, however, were immediately put to death. He, with his brother <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abú-Talíb</mark><mark class="term correction">Abú-Ṭálib</mark>, was delivered into the hands of
    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark>, who was instructed to conduct them to <mark class="term misspelled">Sang-Sar</mark><mark class="term correction">Sang-Sár</mark>.
<p></p>Meanwhile <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>, accompanied by seven of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark><mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark>, set out from that town to share in the meritorious act of inflicting the
    punishment of death upon the companions of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>. When they found that they had already been put to death, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark> urged the prince to
    reconsider his decision and to order the immediate execution of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, pleading that his arrival at <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark><mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark> would be the signal for fresh disturbances
    as grave as those which had already afflicted them. The prince eventually yielded, on the express condition that he be regarded as his guest until his own
    arrival at <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark><mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark>, at which time he would take whatever measures were required to prevent him from disturbing the peace of the neighbourhood.
<p></p>No sooner had <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark> taken the direction of <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark><mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark> than he proceeded to vilify <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and his father. “Why <mark class="term unknown">ill-treat</mark> a guest,” his captive
    pleaded, “whom the prince has committed to your charge? Why ignore the Prophet’s injunction, <mark class="term unknown">‘Honour</mark> thy guest though he be an <mark class="term unknown">infidel’</mark>?” Roused to a burst
    of fury, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>, <a name="Page_408"></a>together with his seven companions, drew their swords and cut his body to pieces. With his last breath
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> was heard invoking the aid of the <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>. As to his brother <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abú-Talíb</mark><mark class="term correction">Abú-Ṭálib</mark>, he was safely conducted to <mark class="term misspelled">Sang-Sar</mark><mark class="term correction">Sang-Sár</mark> by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark>, and to this day resides with his brother <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Riḍá</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>. Both are engaged in the service of the Cause and are accounted
    among its active supporters.
<p></p>As soon as his work was completed, the prince, accompanied by <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, returned to <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>. They arrived on Friday afternoon, the eighteenth of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádiyu’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark><mark class="term correction">Jamádíyu’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark>.<a href="#_ftn415" name="_ftnref415" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> The <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>, together with all the
    <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of the town, came out to welcome the prince and to extend their congratulations on his triumphal return. The whole town was beflagged to celebrate
    the victory, and the bonfires which blazed at night witnessed to the joy with which a grateful population greeted the return of the prince. Three days of
    festivities elapsed during which he gave no indication as to his intention regarding the fate of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>. He vacillated in his policy, and was extremely
    reluctant to <mark class="term unknown">ill-treat</mark> his captive. He at first refused to allow the people to gratify their feelings of unrelenting hatred, and was able to restrain their
    fury. He had originally intended to conduct him to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and, by delivering him into the hands of his sovereign, to relieve himself of the responsibility
    which weighed upon him.
<p></p>The <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>’s unquenchable hostility, however, interfered with the execution of this plan. The hatred with which <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and his Cause inspired him
    blazed into furious rage as he witnessed the increasing evidences of the prince’s inclination to allow so formidable an opponent to slip from his grasp.
    Day and night he remonstrated with him and, with every cunning that his resourceful brain could devise, sought to dissuade him from pursuing a policy which
    he thought to be at once disastrous and cowardly. In the fury of his despair, he appealed to the mob and sought, by inflaming their passions, to awaken the
basest sentiments of revenge in their hearts. The whole of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> had been aroused by the persistency of his call. His diabolical skill    <a name="Page_409"></a>soon won him the sympathy and support of the masses. “I have vowed,” he imperiously protested, “to deny myself both food and sleep
    until such time as I am able to end the life of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark> with my own hands!” The threats of an agitated multitude reinforced his plea and
    succeeded in arousing the apprehensions of the prince. Fearing that his own life might be endangered, he summoned to his presence the leading <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> for the purpose of consulting as to the measures that should be taken to allay the tumult of popular excitement. All those who had been
    invited responded with the exception of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-Ḥamzih</mark>, who pleaded to be excused from attending that meeting. He had previously, on several
    occasions, endeavoured, during the siege of the fort, to persuade the people to refrain from violence. To him <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, a few days before his abandonment of
    the fort, had committed, through one of his trusted companions of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, a locked saddlebag containing the text of his own interpretation of the <mark class="term correct">Sád</mark>
    of <mark class="term misspelled">Samad</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣamad</mark> as well as all his other writings and papers that he had in his possession, the fate of which remains unknown until the present day.
<p></p>No sooner had the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> assembled than the prince gave orders for <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> to be brought into their presence. Since the day of his abandoning the fort,
    <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, who had been delivered into the custody of the <mark class="term correct">Farrá<u>sh</u>-Bá<u>sh</u>í</mark>, had not been summoned to his presence. As soon as he arrived, the
    prince arose and invited him to be seated by his side. Turning to the <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>, he urged that his conversations with him be dispassionately and
    conscientiously conducted. “Your discussions,” he asserted, “must revolve around, and be based upon, the verses of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> and the traditions of
    <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, by which means alone you can demonstrate the truth or falsity of your contentions.” “For what reason,” the <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> impertinently
    enquired, “have you, by choosing to place a green turban upon your head, arrogated to yourself a right which only he who is a true descendant of the
    Prophet can claim? Do you not know that whoso defies this sacred tradition is accursed of God?” “Was <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Murtadá</mark><mark class="term correction">Murtaḍá</mark>,” <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> calmly replied, “whom all the
    recognised <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> praise and esteem, a descendant of <a name="Page_410"></a>the Prophet through his father or his mother?” One of those present at that
    gathering instantly declared the mother alone to have been a siyyid. “Why, then, object to me,” retorted <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, “since my mother was always recognised by
    the inhabitants of this town as a lineal descendant of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>? Was she not, because of her descent, honoured, nay venerated, by every one of you?”
<p></p><p>No one dared to contradict him. The <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> burst forth into a fit of indignation and despair. Angrily he flung his turban to the ground and arose
    to leave the meeting. “This man,” he thundered, ere he departed, “has succeeded in proving to you that he is a descendent of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>. He will, ere
    long, justify his claim to be the mouthpiece of God and the revealer of His will!” The prince was moved to make this declaration: “I wash my hands of all
    responsibility for any harm that may befall this man. You are free to do what you like with him. You will yourselves be answerable to God on the Day of
    Judgment.” Immediately after he had spoken these words, he called for his horse and, accompanied by his attendants, departed for <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark>. Intimidated by the
    imprecations of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> and forgetful of his oath, he abjectly surrendered <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> to the hands of an unrelenting foe, those ravening wolves who panted
    for the moment when they could pounce, with uncontrolled violence, upon their prey, and let loose on him the fiercest passions of revenge and hate.
</p>No sooner had the prince freed them from the restraints which he had exercised than the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> and the people of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>, acting under orders
    from the <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>,<a href="#_ftn416" name="_ftnref416" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> arose to perpetrate upon the body of their victim
    acts of such atrocious cruelty as no pen can describe. By the testimony of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, that heroic youth, who was still on the threshold of his life, was
    subjected to such tortures and suffered <a name="Page_411"></a>such a death as even Jesus had not faced in the hour of His greatest agony. The absence of
    any restraint on the part of the government authorities, the ingenious barbarity which the <mark class="term unknown">torture-mongers</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> so ably displayed, the
    fierce fanaticism which glowed in the breasts of its <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark> inhabitants, the moral support accorded to them by the dignitaries of Church and State
    in the capital—above all, the acts of heroism which their victim and his companions had accomplished and which had served to heighten their exasperation,
    all combined to nerve the hand of the assailants and to add to the diabolical ferocity which characterised his martyrdom.
<p></p>Such were its circumstances that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, who was then confined in the castle of <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, was unable for a period of six months either to write or
    to dictate. The deep grief which he felt had stilled the voice of revelation and silenced His pen. How deeply He mourned His loss! What cries of anguish He
must have uttered as the tale of the siege, the untold sufferings, the shameless betrayal, and the wholesale massacre of the companions of <u>Sh</u>ay    <u>kh</u><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> reached His ears and was unfolded before His eyes! What pangs of sorrow He must have felt when He learned of the shameful treatment which
    His beloved <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> had undergone in his hour of martyrdom at the hands of the people of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>; how he was stripped of his clothes; how the
    turban which He had bestowed upon him had been befouled; how, barefooted, bareheaded, and loaded with chains, he was paraded through the streets, followed
    and scorned by the entire population of the town; how he was execrated and spat upon by the howling mob; how he was assailed with the knives and axes of
    the scum of its female inhabitants; how his body was pierced and mutilated, and how eventually it was delivered to the flames!
<p></p>Amidst his torments, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> was heard whispering forgiveness to his foes. “Forgive, O my God,” he cried, “the trespasses of this people. Deal with them in
    Thy mercy, for they know not what we already have discovered and cherish. I have striven to show them the path that leads to their salvation; behold how
    they have risen to overwhelm and kill me! Show them, O God, the way of Truth, and turn their ignorance into faith.” In his hour of agony, the
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Qumí</mark>, <a name="Page_412"></a>who had so treacherously deserted the fort, was seen passing by his side. Observing his helplessness, he smote him in
    the face. “You claimed,” he cried in haughty scorn, “that your voice was the voice of God. If you speak the truth, burst your bonds asunder and free
    yourself from the hands of your enemies.” <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> looked steadfastly into his <a name="Page_413"></a>face, sighed deeply, and said: “May God requite you for
    your deed, inasmuch as you have helped to add to the measure of my afflictions.” Approaching the <mark class="term correct">Sabzih-Maydán</mark>, he raised his voice and said: “Would that
    my mother were with me, and could see with her own eyes the splendour of my nuptials!” He had scarcely spoken these words when the enraged multitude fell
    upon him and, tearing his body to pieces, threw the scattered members into the fire which they had kindled far that purpose. In the middle of the night,
what still remained of the fragments of that burned and mutilated body was gathered by the hand of a devoted friend<a href="#_ftn417" name="_ftnref417" title="">[*************************]</a> and interred in a place not far distant from the scene of his martyrdom.    <a href="#_ftn418" name="_ftnref418" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a><p></p>It would be appropriate at this juncture to place on record the names of those martyrs who participated in the defence of the fort of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, in the hope that generations yet to come may recall with pride and gratitude the names, no less than the deeds, of those pioneers who, by their
    life and death, have so greatly enriched the annals of God’s immortal Faith. Such names as I have been able to collect from various sources, and for which
    I am particularly indebted <a name="Page_414"></a>to <mark class="term correct">Ismu’lláhu’l-Mím</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ismu’lláhu’l-Javád</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Ismu’lláhu’l-Asad</mark>, I now proceed to enumerate, trusting that
    even as in the world beyond their souls have been invested with the light of unfading glory, their names may likewise linger for ever on the tongues of
    men; that their mention may continue to evoke a like spirit of enthusiasm and devotion in the hearts of those to whom this priceless heritage has been
    transmitted. From my informants I not only have been able to gather the names of most of those who fell in the course of that memorable siege, but have
also succeeded in obtaining a representative, though incomplete, list of all those martyrs who, from the year <mark class="term unknown">’</mark>60    <a href="#_ftn419" name="_ftnref419" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> until the present day, the latter part of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’l-Avval</mark><mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’l-Avval</mark> in the
    year 1306 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn420" name="_ftnref420" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> have laid down their lives in the path of the Cause of God. It
    is my intention to make mention of each of these names in connection with the particular event with which it is chiefly connected. As to those who quaffed
    the cup of martyrdom while defending the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, their names are as follows:
<p></p>1. First and foremost among them stands <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, upon whom the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> bestowed the name of <mark class="term misspelled">Ismu’lláhu’l-A<u>kh</u>ar</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismu’lláhu’l-Á<u>kh</u>ar</mark>.<a href="#_ftn421" name="_ftnref421" title="">[**************************]</a> He, the Last Letter of the Living and the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s chosen companion    <a name="Page_415"></a>on His pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, was, together with <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Akbar-i-Ardistání</mark>, the first to suffer
    persecution on Persian soil for the sake of the Cause of God. He was only eighteen years of age when he left his native town of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> for
    <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. For about four years he sat at the feet of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, and at the age of <mark class="term unknown">twenty-two</mark> met and recognised his Beloved in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. Five years
later, on the <mark class="term unknown">twenty-third</mark> day of <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádiyu’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark><mark class="term correction">Jamádíyu’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark> in the year 1265 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn422" name="_ftnref422" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> he was destined to fall, in the <mark class="term correct">Sabzih-Maydán</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>, a victim
    of the most refined and wanton barbarity at the hands of the enemy. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and, at a later time, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> have mourned in unnumbered Tablets and
    prayers his loss, and have lavished on him their eulogies. Such was the honour accorded to him by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> that in His commentary on the verse of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Kullu’t-Tá’am</mark><mark class="term correction">Kullu’ṭ-Ṭa’ám</mark>,<a href="#_ftn423" name="_ftnref423" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> which He revealed while in <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>, He conferred upon
    him the unrivalled station of the <mark class="term correct">Nuqṭiy-i-U<u>kh</u>rá</mark>,<a href="#_ftn424" name="_ftnref424" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> a station second to
    none except that of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> Himself.<a href="#_ftn425" name="_ftnref425" title="">[***************************]</a>2. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, surnamed the <mark class="term correct">Bábu’l-Báb</mark>, the first to recognise and embrace the new Revelation. At the age of eighteen, he, too, departed from his native
    town of <mark class="term correct">Bu<u>sh</u>rúyih</mark> in <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> for <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, and for a period of nine years <a name="Page_416"></a>remained closely associated with <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. Four years prior to the Declaration of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, acting according to the instructions of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, he met in <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark> the learned <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Báqir-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark> and in <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Askarí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Askarí</mark>, to both of whom he delivered with dignity and eloquence the messages with which he had been
    entrusted by his leader. The circumstances attending his martyrdom evoked the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s inexpressible sorrow, a sorrow that found vent in eulogies and prayers
    of such great number as would be equivalent to thrice the volume of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>. In one of His visiting Tablets, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> asserts that the very dust of the
    ground where the remains of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> lie buried is endowed with such potency as to bring joy to the disconsolate and healing to the sick. In the
    <mark class="term correct">Kitáb-i-Íqán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> extols with still greater force the virtues of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. “But for him,” He writes, “God would not have been established upon
    the seat of His mercy, nor have ascended the throne of eternal glory!”<a href="#_ftn426" name="_ftnref426" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a><p></p>3. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥasan</mark>, the brother of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>.
<p></p>4. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark>, the nephew of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. He, as well as <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥasan</mark>, accompanied <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> from <mark class="term correct">Bu<u>sh</u>rúyih</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> and
    from thence to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, where they embraced the Message of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and were enrolled among the Letters of the Living. With the exception of the
    journey of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> to the castle of <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>, they continued to be with him until the time they suffered martyrdom in the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>.
<p></p>5. The <mark class="term unknown">brother-in-law</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, the father of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Ḥasan</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥusayn</mark>, both of whom are now in <mark class="term correct">Bu<u>sh</u>rúyih</mark>, and into whose
    hands the care of the <mark class="term correct">Varaqatu’l-Firdaws</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>’s sister, is committed. Both are firm and devoted adherents of the Faith.
<p></p>6. The son of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, the elder brother of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-Furú<u>gh</u>í</mark>. He, unlike his uncle, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, suffered martyrdom and
    was, as testified by the latter, a youth of great piety and distinguished for his learning and his integrity of character. <a name="Page_417"></a>7. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark>, known as <mark class="term misspelled">Haratí</mark><mark class="term correction">Harátí</mark>, though originally a resident of <mark class="term misspelled">Qayin</mark><mark class="term correction">Qáyin</mark>. He was a close relative of the father of <mark class="term correct">Nabíl-i-Akbar</mark>, and was the first
    in <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark> to embrace the Cause. It was he who built the <mark class="term correct">Bábíyyih</mark>, and who devotedly served <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> during his sojourn in that city. When <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> hoisted the Black Standard, he, together with his child, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-Káẓim</mark>, eagerly enrolled under his banner and went forth with him to
    <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>. That child was saved eventually, and has now grown up into a fervent and active supporter of the Faith in <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>. It was <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark> who acted as the <mark class="term unknown">standard-bearer</mark> of the company, who designed the plan of the fort, its walls and turrets and the moat which surrounded it,
    who succeeded <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> in organising the forces of his companions and in leading the charge against the enemy, and who acted as the intimate companion,
    the lieutenant and trusted counsellor of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> until the hour when he fell a martyr in the path of the Cause.
<p></p>8. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqíy-i-Juvayní</mark>, a native of Sabzihvar, who was distinguished for his literary accomplishments and was often entrusted by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
    with the task of leading the charge against the assailants. His head and that of his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-companion</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Báqir</mark>, were impaled on spears and
    paraded through the streets of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark>, amid the shouts and howling of an excited populace.
<p></p>9. <mark class="term correct">Qambar-‘Alí</mark>, the fearless and faithful servant of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who accompanied him on his journey to <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark> and who suffered martyrdom on the very
    night on which his master fell a victim to the bullets of the enemy.
<p></p>10. <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> and
<p></p><p>11. <mark class="term correct">Qulí</mark>, who, together with a man named <mark class="term correct">Iskandar</mark>, a native of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, bore the body of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> to the fort on the night of his martyrdom and placed
    it at the feet of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>. He it was, the same <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, who, by the orders of the chief constable of <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, was led by a halter through the streets
    of that city.
</p>12. <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥasan</mark>, the brother of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark>, whom the comrades of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark> slew on the way between <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> and the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. He
    distinguished himself <a name="Page_418"></a>by his unwavering constancy, and had been one of the servants of the shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark>.
<p></p>13. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark>, who, with <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Yúsúf-i-Ardibílí</mark><mark class="term correction">Yúsuf-i-Ardibílí</mark>, was commissioned by <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> to meet the prince, and who brought back with him the sealed copy of the
    <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> bearing the oath which the prince had written. He was one of the <mark class="term unknown">well-known</mark> siyyids of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, and was recognised for his learning as well
    as for the integrity of his character.
<p></p>14. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mardán-‘Alí</mark>, one of the noted companions from <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, a resident of the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Miyamay</mark><mark class="term correction">Míyámay</mark>, the site of a <mark class="term unknown">well-fortified</mark> fortress
    situated between Sabzihvar and <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>áh-Rud</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>áh-Rúd</mark>. He, together with <mark class="term unknown">thirty-three</mark> companions, enlisted under the banner of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> on the day of the
    latter’s passage through that village. It was in the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Miyamay</mark><mark class="term correction">Míyámay</mark>, to which <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had repaired in order to offer the Friday congregational
    prayer, that he delivered his <mark class="term unknown">soul-stirring</mark> appeal in which he laid stress upon the fulfilment of the tradition relating to the hoisting of the Black
    Standard in <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, and in which he declared himself to be its bearer. His eloquent address profoundly impressed his hearers, so much so that on
    that very day the majority of those who heard him, most of whom were men of distinguished merit, arose and followed him. Only one of those <mark class="term unknown">thirty-three</mark>
    companions, a <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Isa</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Ísá</mark>, survived, whose sons are at present in the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Miyamay</mark><mark class="term correction">Míyámay</mark>, actively engaged in the service of the Cause.

<p></p>Of the believers of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>úy</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>uy</mark>, the following have suffered martyrdom:
<p></p>147. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark>, a distinguished divine, who had been one of the esteemed disciples of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>. He was noted for his learning, his eloquence, and his

    apprehensions of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Karím</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> on his arrival at <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark>, and who struck terror to the hearts of his adversaries. “This man,” <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Karím</mark><u>Kh</u><mark class="term unknown">án</mark> was heard to say to his congregation, “must needs be expelled from this town, for if he be allowed to remain, he will assuredly <a name="Page_424"></a>cause the same tumult in <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark> as he has already done in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. The injury he will inflict will be irreparable. The magic of his eloquence and the
    force of his personality, if they do not already excel those of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, are certainly not inferior to them.” By this means he was able to force him
    to curtail his stay in <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark> and to prevent him from addressing the people from the pulpit. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> gave him the following instructions: “You must visit
the towns and cities of Persia and summon their inhabitants to the Cause of God. On the first day of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark> in the year 1265 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn427" name="_ftnref427" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> you must be in <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> and must arise to lend every assistance in your

    he visited. On his arrival in <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, he was made captive by the forces of Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, who immediately recognised him and gave orders that
    he be imprisoned. He was eventually released, as we have already observed, by the companions of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> on the day of the battle of <mark class="term misspelled">Vas-Kas</mark><mark class="term correction">Vás-Kas</mark>.

He
    was famed for his intelligence and learning, and was subjected, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> only excepted, to the severest atrocities that have ever befallen a defender of the
    fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. The prince had promised that he would release him on condition that he would execrate the name of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, and had pledged his word that,
    should he be willing to recant, he would take him back with him to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and make him the tutor of his sons. “Never will I consent,” he replied, “to
    vilify the beloved of God at the bidding of a man such as you. Were you to confer upon me the whole of the kingdom of Persia, I would not for one moment
    turn my face from my beloved leader. My body is at your mercy, my soul you are powerless to subdue. Torture me as you will, that I may be enabled to

    pieces and that no effort be spared to inflict upon him a most humiliating punishment.
<p></p>172. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-Karrádí</mark>, whose home was situated in one of the palm groves adjoining the old city of <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>, a man of great courage who had
    fought and led a hundred men in the war against <mark class="term correct">Ibráhím</mark><mark class="term correct">Pá<u>sh</u>á</mark> of Egypt. He had been a fervent disciple of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, and was the author of a long
    poem in which he expatiated upon the virtues and merits of the siyyid. He was <mark class="term unknown">seventy-five</mark> years old when he embraced the Faith of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, whom he
    likewise eulogised in an eloquent and detailed poem. He distinguished himself by his heroic acts during the siege of the fort, and eventually became a

<p></p>173. <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’íd-i-Jabbáví</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘íd-i-Jabbáví</mark>, a native of <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>, who displayed extraordinary courage during the siege. He was shot in the abdomen, and, though severely

<p></p>The circumstances of the martyrdom of these last two companions were related by <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abú-Tálib-i-Sang-Sarí</mark><mark class="term correction">Abú-Ṭálib-i-Sang-Sárí</mark>, one of those who survived that memorable

    <mark class="term correct">Mír</mark><mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark>, both of whom were martyred while defending the fort. “On the day on which <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark> was slain,” he wrote, “I happened to be the guest
    of a certain <mark class="term correct">Karbilá’í</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Ján</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">kad-<u>kh</u>udá</mark><a href="#_ftn429" name="_ftnref429" title="">[****************************]</a> of one of the
    villages in the neighbourhood of the fort. He had gone to assist in the protection of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>usraw</mark>, and had returned and was relating to me the
    circumstances attending his death. On that very day, a messenger informed me that two Arabs had arrived at that village and were anxious to join the
    occupants of the fort. They expressed their fear of the people of the village of <mark class="term correct">Qádí-Kalá</mark>, and promised that they would amply reward whoever would be
    willing to conduct them to their destination. I recalled the counsels of my father, <mark class="term correct">Mír</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>, who exhorted me to arise and <a name="Page_427"></a>help in the promotion of the Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. I immediately decided to seize the opportunity that had presented itself to me, and, together with these two
    Arabs, and with the aid and assistance of the <mark class="term unknown">Kad-<u>kh</u>udá</mark>, reached the fort, met <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and determined to consecrate the remaining days of my

<p></p>As to those believers who participated in that memorable siege and survived its tragic end, I have been thus far unable to ascertain in full either their
    names or their number. I have contented myself with a representative, though incomplete, list of the names of its martyrs, trusting that in the days to
    come the valiant promoters of the Faith will arise to fill this gap, and will, by their research and industry, be able to remedy the imperfections of this
    altogether inadequate description of what must ever remain as one of the most moving episodes of modern times. <a name="Page_430"></a>CHAPTER XXI: THE SEVEN MARTYRS OF <mark class="term correct">ṬIHRÁN</mark>THE news of the tragic fate which had befallen the heroes of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> brought immeasurable sorrow to the heart of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. Confined it His <mark class="term unknown">prison-castle</mark> of    <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, severed from the little band of His struggling disciples, He watched with keen anxiety the progress of their labours and prayed with
unremitting zeal for their victory. How great was His sorrow when, in the early days of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>a’bán</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>a‘bán</mark> in the year 1265 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn430" name="_ftnref430" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> He came to learn of the trials that had beset their path, of the agony
    they had suffered, of the betrayal to which an exasperated enemy had felt compelled to resort, and of the abominable butchery with which their career had
    ended.
<p></p>“The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was <mark class="term unknown">heart-broken</mark>,” His amanuensis, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-‘Azíz</mark>, subsequently related, “at the receipt of this unexpected intelligence. He was crushed
    with grief, a grief that stilled His voice and silenced His pen. For nine days He refused to meet any of His friends. I myself, though His close and
    constant attendant, was refused admittance. Whatever meat or drink we offered Him, He was disinclined to touch. Tears rained continually from His eyes, and
    expressions of anguish dropped unceasingly from His lips. I could hear Him, from behind the curtain, give vent to His feelings of sadness as He communed,
    in the privacy of His cell, with His Beloved. I attempted to jot down the effusions of His sorrow as they poured forth from His wounded heart. Suspecting
    that I was attempting to preserve the lamentations He uttered, He bade me destroy whatever I had recorded. Nothing remains of the moans and cries with
    which that <mark class="term unknown">heavy-laden</mark> heart sought to relieve itself of the pangs that had seized it. For a period of five months He languished, immersed in an ocean of
    despondency and sorrow.” <a name="Page_431"></a>With the advent of <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark> in the year 1266 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn431" name="_ftnref431" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> again resumed
    the work He had been compelled to interrupt. The first page He wrote was dedicated to the memory of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. In the visiting Tablet revealed in his
    honour, He extolled, in moving terms, the unswerving fidelity with which he served <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> throughout the siege of the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. He lavished His
    eulogies on his magnanimous conduct, recounted his exploits, and asserted his undoubted reunion in the world beyond with the leader whom he had so nobly
    served. He too, He wrote, would soon join those twin immortals, each of whom had, by his life and death, shed imperishable lustre on the Faith of God. For
    one whole week the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> continued to write His praises of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and of His other companions who had gained the crown of martyrdom at
    <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>.
<p></p>No sooner had He completed His eulogies of those who had immortalised their names in the defence of the fort, than He summoned, on the day of A<u>sh</u>
ura,<a href="#_ftn432" name="_ftnref432" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Adi-Guzal</mark><mark class="term correction">Ádí-Guzal</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn433" name="_ftnref433" title="">[*****************************]</a> one of the believers of <mark class="term correct">Mará<u>gh</u>ih</mark>, who for the last two months had
    been acting as His attendant instead of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, the brother of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-‘Azíz</mark>. He affectionately received him, bestowed upon him the name
    <mark class="term misspelled">Sáyyah</mark><mark class="term correction">Sayyáḥ</mark>, entrusted to his care the visiting Tablets He had revealed in memory of the martyrs of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, and bade him perform, on His behalf, a pilgrimage
    to that spot. “Arise,” He urged him, “and with complete detachment proceed, in the guise of a traveller, to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, and there visit, on My behalf, the
    spot which enshrines the bodies of those immortals who, with their blood, have sealed their faith in My Cause. As you approach the precincts of that
    hallowed ground, put off your shoes and, bowing your head in reverence to their memory, invoke their names and prayerfully make the circuit of their
shrine. Bring back to Me, as a remembrance of your visit, a handful of that holy earth which covers the remains of My beloved ones, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><a name="Page_432"></a><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. Strive to be back ere the day of <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, that you may celebrate with Me that festival, the only one I probably shall ever
    see again.”
<p></p><p>Faithful to the instructions he had received, <mark class="term misspelled">Sáyyah</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sayyáḥ</mark> set out on his pilgrimage to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>. He reached his destination on the first day of <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’l-Avval</mark> <mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’l-Avval</mark>
in the year 1266 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn434" name="_ftnref434" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> and by the ninth day of that same month,    <a href="#_ftn435" name="_ftnref435" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> the first anniversary of the martyrdom of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, he had performed
    his visit and acquitted himself of the mission with which he had been entrusted. From thence he proceeded to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>.
</p>I have heard <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark>, who received <mark class="term misspelled">Sáyyah</mark><mark class="term correction">Sayyáḥ</mark> at the entrance of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s home in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, relate the following: “It was the depth of winter when
    <mark class="term misspelled">Sáyyah</mark><mark class="term correction">Sayyáḥ</mark>, returning from his pilgrimage, came to visit <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. Despite the cold and snow of a rigorous winter, he appeared attired in the garb of a
    dervish, poorly clad, barefooted, and dishevelled. His heart was set afire with the flame that pilgrimage had kindled. No sooner had <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Yaḥyáy-i-Darábí</mark><mark class="term correction">Yaḥyáy-i-Dárábí</mark>, surnamed <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, who was then a guest in the home of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, been informed of the return of <mark class="term misspelled">Sáyyah</mark><mark class="term correction">Sayyáḥ</mark> from the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, than he,
    oblivious of the pomp and circumstance to which a man of his position had been accustomed, rushed forward and flung himself at the feet of the pilgrim.
    Holding his legs, which had been covered with mud to the knees, in his arms, he kissed them devoutly. I was amazed that day at the many evidences of loving
    solicitude which <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> evinced towards <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>. He showed him such favours as I had never seen Him extend to anyone. The manner of His conversation
    left no doubt in me that this same <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> would ere long distinguish himself by deeds no less remarkable than those which had immortalised the defenders of
    the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term misspelled">Sáyyah</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sayyáḥ</mark> tarried a few days in that home. He was, however, unable to perceive, as did <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, the nature of that power which lay latent in his Host. Though
    himself the recipient of the utmost favour from <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, he failed to apprehend the significance of the blessings that were being showered upon him. I
    have heard him recount his experiences, during his sojourn in Famagusta: “<mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> overwhelmed <a name="Page_433"></a>me with His kindness. As to <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>,
    notwithstanding the eminence of his position, he invariably gave me preference over himself whenever in the presence of his Host. On the day of my arrival
    from <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, he went so far as to kiss my feet. I was amazed at the reception accorded me in that home. Though immersed in an ocean of bounty, I
    failed, in those days, to appreciate the position then occupied by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, nor was I able to suspect, however dimly, the nature of the Mission He was
    destined to perform.”
</p><p>Ere the departure of <mark class="term misspelled">Sáyyah</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sayyáḥ</mark> from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> entrusted him with an epistle, the text of which He had dictated to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn436" name="_ftnref436" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> and sent it in his name. Shortly after, a reply, penned in the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s own
    handwriting, in which He commits <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark> to the care of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and urges that attention be paid to his education and training, was received. That
    communication the people of the <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark><a href="#_ftn437" name="_ftnref437" title="">[******************************]</a> have misconstrued as an evidence of
    the exaggerated claims<a href="#_ftn438" name="_ftnref438" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> which they have advanced in favour of their
    leader. Although the text of that reply is absolutely devoid of such pretensions, and does not, beyond the praise it bestows upon <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and the
    request it makes for the upbringing of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark>, contain any reference to his alleged position, yet his followers have idly imagined that that letter
constitutes an assertion of the authority with which they have invested him.    <a href="#_ftn439" name="_ftnref439" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a>
</p>At this stage of my narrative, when I have already recounted the outstanding events that occurred in the course <a name="Page_434"></a>of the year 1265
    A.H.,<a href="#_ftn440" name="_ftnref440" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> I am reminded that that very year witnessed the most significant
    event in my own life, an event which marked my spiritual rebirth, my deliverance from the fetters of the past, and my acceptance of the message of this
    Revelation. I seek the indulgence of the reader if I dwell too long on the circumstances of my early life, and recount with too great detail the events
    that led to my conversion. My father belonged to the tribe of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirí</mark>, who led a nomadic life in the province of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. His name was <mark class="term correct"><u>Gh</u>ulám</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, son of <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-‘Arab</mark>. He married the daughter of <mark class="term correct">Kalb-‘Alí</mark>, and by her had three sons and three daughters. I was his second son, and was given the
name of <mark class="term misspelled">Yar-Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correction">Yár-Muḥammad</mark>. I was born on the eighteenth of <mark class="term misspelled">Safar</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣafar</mark> in the year 1247 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn441" name="_ftnref441" title="">[*******************************]</a> in the village of <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark>. I was a shepherd by profession, and was given
    in my early days a most rudimentary education. I longed to devote more time to my studies, but was unable to do so, owing to the exigencies of my
    situation. I read the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> with eagerness, committed several of its passages to memory, and chanted them whilst I followed my flock over the fields. I
    loved solitude, and watched the stars at night with delight and wonder. In the quiet of the wilderness, I recited certain prayers attributed to the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, the Commander of the Faithful, and, as I turned my face towards the <mark class="term correct">Qiblih</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn442" name="_ftnref442" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> supplicated the Almighty to guide my steps and enable me to find the
    Truth.
<p></p>My father oftentimes took me with him to <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, where I became acquainted with the teachings of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> and the ways and manners of its leaders. He was a
    devout follower of that Faith, and was closely associated with the ecclesiastical leaders who congregated in that city. I watched him as he prayed at the
    <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-Imám-Ḥasan</mark> and performed, with scrupulous care and extreme piety, all the rites and ceremonies prescribed by his Faith. I heard the preaching of
    several eminent <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> who had arrived from <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark>, attended their lectures, and listened to their disputations. Gradually I came to perceive their
    insincerity and to loathe the baseness of their character. Eager as I was to ascertain the trustworthiness of the creeds and dogmas which they strove to
    impose upon me, I could neither find the time nor obtain the <a name="Page_435"></a>facilities with which to satisfy my desire. I was often rebuked by my
    father for my temerity and restlessness. “I fear,” he often remarked, “that your aversion to these <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> may some day involve you in great difficulties
    and bring upon you reproach and shame.”
<p></p><p>I was in the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Rubat-Karím</mark> <mark class="term correction">Rubát-Karím</mark>, on a visit to my maternal uncle, when, on the twelfth day after <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, in the year 1263 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn443" name="_ftnref443" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> I accidentally overheard, in the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> of that village, a conversation
    between two men which first made me acquainted with the Revelation of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. “Have you heard,” one of them remarked, “that the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> has been
    conducted to the village of <mark class="term correct">Kinár-Gird</mark> and is on his way to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>?” Finding his friend ignorant of that episode, he proceeded to relate the whole story of
    the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, giving a detailed account of the circumstances attending His Declaration, of His arrest in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, His departure for <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, the reception
    which both the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Manú<u>ch</u>ihr</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> had extended to Him, the prodigies and wonders He had manifested, and the verdict that the
    <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark> had pronounced against Him. Every detail of that story excited my curiosity and stirred in me a keen admiration for a Man who could
    throw such a spell over His countrymen. His light seemed to have flooded my soul; I felt as if I were already a convert to His Cause.
</p>From <mark class="term misspelled">Rubat-Karím</mark><mark class="term correction">Rubát-Karím</mark> I returned to <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark>. My father remarked Upon my restlessness, and expressed his surprise at my behaviour. I had lost my appetite and
    sleep, and was determined to conceal the secret of my inner agitation from my father, lest its disclosure might interfere with the eventual realisation of
    my hopes. I remained in that state until a certain <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ḥusayn-i-Zavari’í</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥusayn-i-Zavári’í</mark> arrived at <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark> and was able to enlighten me on a subject which had become
    the ruling passion of my life. Our acquaintance speedily ripened into a friendship which encouraged me to share with him the longings of my heart. To my
    great surprise, I found him already enthralled by the secret of the theme which I had begun to disclose to him. “One of my cousins,” he proceeded to
    relate, “<mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl-i-Zavari’í</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl-i-Zavári’í</mark> by name, convinced me of the truth of the Message proclaimed by the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>. <a name="Page_436"></a>He informed me
    that he had several times met the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> in the house of the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, and had seen Him actually reveal, in the presence of His host, a
    commentary on the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Va’l-‘Asr</mark><mark class="term correction">Va’l-‘Aṣr</mark>.<a href="#_ftn444" name="_ftnref444" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> The rapidity of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s
    composition, and the force and originality of His style, had excited his surprise and admiration. He was amazed to find that, whilst revealing His
    commentary, and without lessening the speed of His writing, He was able to answer whatever questions those who were present were moved to ask Him. The
fearlessness with which my cousin arose to preach the Message aroused the hostility of the <mark class="term correct">kad-<u>kh</u>udás</mark><a href="#_ftn445" name="_ftnref445" title="">[********************************]</a> and siyyids of <mark class="term correct">Zavárih</mark>, who compelled him to return to <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, where
    he had of late been residing. I too, unable to remain in <mark class="term correct">Zavárih</mark>, departed for <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>, in which town I spent the winter and met <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Jání</mark>, of
    whom my cousin had spoken, and who gave me a treatise written by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, entitled <mark class="term misspelled">‘Risaliy-i-’Adlíyyih</mark><mark class="term correction">Risáliy-i-‘Adlíyyih</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> urging me to read it carefully and return it to
    him after a few days. I was so charmed by the theme and language of that treatise that I proceeded immediately to transcribe the whole text. When I
    returned it to its owner, he, to my profound regret, informed me that I had just missed the opportunity of meeting its Author. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> Himself,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
    he said, <mark class="term unknown">‘arrived</mark> on the eve of the day of <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark> and spent three nights as a Guest in my home. He is now on His way to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, and if you start
    immediately, you will certainly overtake Him.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Straightway I arose and departed, walking all the way from <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark> to a fortress in the neighbourhood
    of <mark class="term correct">Kinár-Gird</mark>. I was resting under the shadow of its walls when a <mark class="term unknown">pleasant-looking</mark> man emerged from that fortress and asked me who I was and whither I was
    going. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> am a poor siyyid,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I replied, <mark class="term unknown">‘a</mark> wayfarer and stranger to this place.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He took me to his home and invited me to spend the night as his guest. In
    the course of his conversation with me, he said: <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> suspect you to be a follower of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> who was staying for a few days in this fortress, from whence
    He was transferred to the village of <mark class="term correct">Kulayn</mark>, and who, three days ago, left for <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>. I esteem myself as one of His adherents. My name is <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark>. I intended not to separate myself <a name="Page_437"></a>from Him, but He bade me remain in this place and convey to any of His friends
    whom I might meet His loving greetings, and dissuade them from following Him. “Tell them,” He instructed me, “to consecrate their lives to the service of
    My Cause, that haply the barriers that hinder the progress of this Faith may be removed, so that My followers may, with safety and freedom, worship their
    God and observe the precepts of their Faith.” I immediately abandoned my project and, instead of returning to <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, decided to come to this place.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p>The story which this <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Ḥusayn-i-Zavari’í</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥusayn-i-Zavári’í</mark> related to me served to allay my agitation. He shared with me the copy of the “<mark class="term misspelled">Risaliy-i-’Adlíyyih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Risáliy-i-‘Adlíyyih</mark>” he had
    brought with him, the reading of which imparted strength and refreshment to my soul. In those days I was a pupil of a siyyid who taught me the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> and
    whose incapacity to enlighten me on the tenets of his Faith became more and more evident in my eyes. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, whom I asked for further information
about the Cause, advised me to meet <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl-i-Zavari’í</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl-i-Zavári’í</mark>, whose invariable practice it was to visit, every spring, the shrines of the <mark class="term unknown">imám-zádihs</mark>    <a href="#_ftn446" name="_ftnref446" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> of <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>. I induced my father, who was reluctant to separate himself
    from me, to send me to that city with the object of perfecting my knowledge of the Arabic language. I was careful to conceal from him my real purpose,
fearing that its disclosure might involve him in embarrassments with the <mark class="term misspelled">Qádí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Qáḍí</mark>    <a href="#_ftn447" name="_ftnref447" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> and the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark> and prevent me from achieving my end.
</p>While I was in <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, my mother, my sister, and my brother came to visit me in connection with the festival of <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, and stayed with me for about a month.
    In the course of their visit, I was able to enlighten my mother and my sister about the new Revelation, and succeeded in kindling in their hearts the love
    of its Author. A few days after their return to <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl</mark>, whom I impatiently awaited, arrived, and was able, in the course of his discussions
    with me, to set forth in detail all that was required to win me over completely to the Cause. He laid stress on the continuity of Divine Revelation,
    asserted the fundamental oneness of the Prophets of the past, and explained their close relationship <a name="Page_438"></a>to the Mission of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. He
    also disclosed the nature of the work accomplished by <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aḥmad-i-Ahsá’í</mark><mark class="term correction">Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim-i-Ra<u>sh</u>tí</mark>, neither of whom I had
    previously heard. I asked as to the duty incumbent at the present time upon every loyal adherent of the Faith. “The injunction of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>,” he replied, “is
    that all those have accepted His Message should proceed to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> and their assistance to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, who is now hemmed in by the forces of an unrelenting
    foe.” I expressed my eagerness to join him, <a name="Page_439"></a>as he himself was intending to journey to the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. He advised me, however,
    to remain in <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark> together with a certain <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Fatḥu’llah-i-Hakkak</mark><mark class="term correction">Fatḥu’lláh-i-Ḥakkák</mark>, a lad of my age whom he had recently guided to the Cause, until the receipt of his
    message from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>.
<p></p>I waited in vain for that message, and, finding that no word came from him, decided to leave for the capital. My friend <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Fatḥu’llah</mark><mark class="term correction">Fatḥu’lláh</mark> subsequently
followed me. He was eventually arrested and shared the fate of those who were put to death in the year 1268 A.H.    <a href="#_ftn448" name="_ftnref448" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> as a result of the attempt on the life or the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>. Arriving in
<mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, I proceeded directly to the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-<u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, which was opposite a <mark class="term correct">madrisih</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn449" name="_ftnref449" title="">[*********************************]</a> at the entrance of which I, later on, unexpectedly encountered <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl-i-Zavari’í</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl-i-Zavári’í</mark>, who hastened to inform me that he had just written me the letter and was on the point of despatching it to <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>.
<p></p>We were preparing ourselves to leave for <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, when the news reached us that the defenders of the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> had been treacherously slaughtered
    and that the fort itself had been levelled with the ground. We were filled with distress at the receipt of the appalling news, and mourned the tragic fate
    of those who had so heroically defended their beloved Cause. One day I unexpectedly came across my maternal uncle, <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz-‘Alí</mark>, who had come on purpose to
    fetch me. I informed <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl</mark>, who advised me to leave for <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark> and not to arouse further hostility on the part of those who insisted upon my
    return.
<p></p>On my arrival at my native village, I was able to win over my brother to the Cause, which my mother and my sister had already embraced. I also succeeded in
    inducing my father to allow me to leave again for <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. I took up my residence in the same <mark class="term correct">madrisih</mark> where I had been accommodated on my previous visit,
    and there met a certain <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Karím</mark>, whom, I subsequently learned, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had named <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>. He affectionately received me and told me
    that <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl</mark> had entrusted me to his care and wished me to remain in his company until the former’s return to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. The days of my companionship
    with <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> will never be forgotten. I found him <a name="Page_440"></a>the very incarnation of love and kindness. The words with which he inspired me
    and animated my faith are indelibly graven upon my heart.
<p></p>Through him I was introduced to the disciples of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, with whom I associated and from whom I obtained fuller information regarding the teachings of the
    Faith. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> was in those days earning his livelihood as a scribe, and devoted his evenings to copying the Persian <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark> and other writings of the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. The copies which he so devotedly prepared were given by him as gifts to his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>. I myself was several times the bearer of such gifts from
    him to the wife of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mihdíy-i-Kandí</mark>, who had forsaken his infant son and hastened to join the occupants of the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>.
<p></p>During those days I was informed that <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>, who, ever since the dispersal of the gathering at <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark>, had been living in <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, had arrived at
    <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and was confined in the house of <mark class="term correct">Maḥmúd</mark><mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Kalántar</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Kalantar</mark>, where, although a prisoner, she was treated with consideration and courtesy.
<p></p>One day <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> conducted me to the house of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, whose wife, the <mark class="term misspelled">Varaqatu’l-’Ulya</mark><mark class="term correction">Varaqatu’l-‘Ulyá</mark>,<a href="#_ftn450" name="_ftnref450" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> the mother of the Most Great Branch,    <a href="#_ftn451" name="_ftnref451" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> had already healed my eyes with an ointment which she herself had
    prepared and sent to me <a name="Page_441"></a>by this same <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>. The first one I met in that house was that same beloved Son of hers, who was then
    a child of six. He smiled His welcome to me as He was standing at the door of the room which <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> occupied. I passed that door, and was ushered into
    the presence of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark>, utterly unaware of the station of the Occupant of the room I had left behind me. When brought face to face with <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark>, I
    was startled, immediately I observed his features and noted his conversation, at his utter unworthiness of the position that had been claimed for him.
<p></p>On another occasion, when I visited that same house, I on the point of entering the room that <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark> occupied, when <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark>, whom I had
previously met, approached and requested me, since <mark class="term misspelled">Iṣfandíyár</mark><mark class="term correction">Isfandíyár</mark>, their servant, had gone to market and had not yet returned, to conduct “<mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark>”    <a href="#_ftn452" name="_ftnref452" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> to the <mark class="term correct">Madrisiy-i-Mírzá-Ṣáliḥ</mark> in his stead and then return to this
place. I gladly consented, and as I was preparing to leave, I saw the Most Great Branch, a child of exquisite beauty, wearing the <mark class="term correct">kuláh</mark><a href="#_ftn453" name="_ftnref453" title="">[**********************************]</a> and cloaked in the <mark class="term misspelled">jubbiy-i-hizari’í</mark><mark class="term correction">jubbiy-i-hizári’í</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn454" name="_ftnref454" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> emerge from the room which His Father occupied, and descend the
    steps leading to the gate of the house. I advanced and stretched forth my arms to carry Him. “We shall walk together,” He said, as He took hold of my hand
    and led me out of the house. We chatted together as we walked hand in hand in the direction of the <mark class="term correct">madrisih</mark> known in those days by the name of <mark class="term misspelled">Pa-Minar</mark><mark class="term correction">Pá-Minár</mark>. As
    we reached His classroom, He turned to me and said: “Come again this afternoon and take me back to my home, for <mark class="term misspelled">Iṣfandíyár</mark><mark class="term correction">Isfandíyár</mark> is unable to fetch me. My Father
    will need him <mark class="term unknown">to-day</mark>.” I gladly acquiesced, and returned immediately to the house of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. There again I met <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark>, who delivered into my
    hands a letter which he asked me to take to the <mark class="term unknown">Madrisiy-i-Sadr</mark> and hand to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, whom I was told I would find in the room occupied by <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Báqir-i-Bastamí</mark><mark class="term correction">Báqir-i-Basṭámí</mark>. He asked me to bring back the reply immediately. I fulfilled the commission and returned to the <mark class="term correct">madrisih</mark> in time to conduct the Most Great
    Branch to His home.
<p></p>One day <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> invited me to meet <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><a name="Page_442"></a><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s maternal uncle, who had recently returned from <u>Ch</u><mark class="term unknown">ihríq</mark> and was staying in the home of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Big-i-<u>Ch</u>apar<u>ch</u>í</mark><mark class="term correction">Big-i-<u>Ch</u>apár<u>ch</u>í</mark>, in the neighbourhood of the gate of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>imírán</mark>. I was struck, when I
    gazed at his face, with the nobility of his features and the serenity of his countenance. My subsequent visits to him served to heighten my admiration for
    the sweetness of his temper, his mystical piety and strength of character. I well remember how on one occasion <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark> urged him, at a certain
    gathering, to leave <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, which was then in a state of great ferment, and escape its dangerous atmosphere. “Why fear for my safety?” he confidently
    replied. “Would that I too could share in the banquet which the hand of Providence is spreading for His chosen ones!”
<p></p><p>Shortly after, the <mark class="term unknown">stirrers-up</mark> of mischief were able to kindle a grave turmoil in that city. Its immediate cause was the action of a certain siyyid from <mark class="term unknown">Ká</mark>    <mark class="term unknown"><u>sh</u>án</mark>, who was living in the <mark class="term misspelled">Madrisiy-i-Daru’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>afa’</mark> <mark class="term correction">Madrisiy-i-Dáru’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>afá’</mark> and whom the <mark class="term unknown">well-known</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> had taken into his confidence and
    claimed to have converted to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s teachings. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥusayn-i-Kirmání</mark>, who lodged in that same <mark class="term correct">madrisih</mark> and who was a <mark class="term unknown">well-known</mark> lecturer on
    the metaphysical doctrines of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, attempted several times to induce <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, <a name="Page_443"></a>who was one of his pupils, to break off his
    acquaintance with that siyyid, whom he believed to be unreliable, and to refuse him admittance to the gathering of the believers. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> refused,
    however, to be admonished by this warning, and continued to associate with him until the beginning of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark> <mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark> in the
    year 1266 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn455" name="_ftnref455" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> at which time the treacherous siyyid went to a
    certain <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, one of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>, and delivered into his hands the names and addresses of about fifty of the believers who were
    then residing in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. That same list was immediately submitted by <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Maḥmúd</mark> <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Kalántar</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Kalantar</mark>, who ordered that all of them be
    arrested. Fourteen of them were seized and brought before the authorities.
</p>One the day they were captured, I happened to be with my brother and my maternal uncle, who had arrived from <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark> and had lodged in a caravanersai
    outside the gate of <mark class="term correct">Naw</mark>. The next morning they departed for <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark>, and <a name="Page_444"></a>as I returned to the <mark class="term unknown">Madrisiy-i-Daru’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u></mark><mark class="term unknown">afa’</mark>, I discovered in my room a package upon which was placed a letter addressed to me by <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>. That letter informed me that the treacherous siyyid
    had at last denounced us and had raised a violent commotion in the capital. “The package which I have left in this room,” he wrote, “contains all the
    sacred writings that are in my possession. If you ever reach this place in safety, take them to the caravanserai of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Nad-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correction">Nád-‘Alí</mark>, where you will find in
    one of its rooms a man bearing that name, a native of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, to whom you will deliver the package together with the letter which accompanies it. From
    thence you will proceed immediately to the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-<u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, where I hope to be able to meet you.” Following his directions, I delivered the package to
    the <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> and succeeded in reaching the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>, where I met <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and heard him relate how he had been assailed and had sought refuge in the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>,
    in the precincts of which he was immune from further attack.
<p></p>In the meantime, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had sent from the <mark class="term unknown">Madrisiyi-Sadr</mark> a message to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> informing him of the designs of the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, who had, already on
    three different occasions, demanded his arrest from the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>. He was also warned that the <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark>, ignoring the right of asylum with which the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>
    had been invested, intended to arrest those who had sought refuge in that sanctuary. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> was urged to leave in disguise for <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, and was charged to
    direct me to return to my home in <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark>.
<p></p>Meanwhile, my relations, who had recognised me in the <mark class="term correct">Masjid-i-<u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, pressed me to leave for <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark>, pleading that my father, who had been
    misinformed of my arrest and impending execution, was in grave distress, and that it was my duty to hasten and relieve him of his anxieties. Acting on the
    advice of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, who counselled me to seize this <mark class="term unknown">God-sent</mark> opportunity, I left for <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark> and celebrate the Feast of <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark> with my family, a Feast
that was doubly blessed inasmuch as it coincided with the fifth day of <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádiyu’l-Avval</mark><mark class="term correction">Jamádíyu’l-Avval</mark> in the year 1266 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn456" name="_ftnref456" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> the anniversary of the day on which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had declared His
    Mission. The <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark> of that year has been mentioned in the “<mark class="term correct">Kitáb-i-Panj-<u>Sh</u>a’n</mark>,” <a name="Page_445"></a>one of the last works of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. “The
sixth <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>,” He wrote in that Book, “after the Declaration of the Point of the <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn457" name="_ftnref457" title="">[***********************************]</a> has fallen on the fifth day of <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádiyu’l-Avval</mark><mark class="term correction">Jamádíyu’l-Avval</mark>, in the seventh
    lunar year after that same Declaration.” In that same passage, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> alludes to the fact that the <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark> of that year would be the last He was destined
    to celebrate on this earth.
<p></p>In the midst of the festivities which my relatives celebrated in <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark>, my heart was set upon <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, and my thoughts centred round the fate which might
    have befallen my <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> in that agitated city. I longed to hear of their safety. Though in the house of my father, and surrounded with the
    solicitude of my parents, I felt oppressed by the thought of being severed from that little band, whose perils I could well imagine and whose afflictions I
    longed to share. The terrible suspense under which I lived, while confined in my home, was unexpectedly relieved by the arrival of <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq-i-Tabrízí</mark>, who
    came from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and was received in the house of my father. Though delivering me from the uncertainties which had been weighing so heavily upon me, he, to
    my profound horror, unfolded to my ears a tale of such terrifying cruelty that the anxieties of suspense paled before the ghastly light which that lurid
    story cast upon my heart.
<p></p>The circumstances of the martyrdom of my arrested brethren in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>—for such was their fate—I now proceed to relate. The fourteen disciples of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>,
who had been captured, remained incarcerated in the house of <mark class="term correct">Maḥmúd</mark><mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Kalántar</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Kalantar</mark> from the first to the <mark class="term unknown">twenty-second</mark> day of the month of <mark class="term unknown">Rabí’u’</mark><mark class="term unknown"><u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark>.<a href="#_ftn458" name="_ftnref458" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a><mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> was also confined on the upper floor
    of that same house. Every kind of ill treatment was inflicted upon them. Their persecutors sought, by every device, to induce them to supply the
    information they required, but failed to obtain a satisfactory answer. Among the captives was a certain <mark class="term unknown">Muḥammad-Ḥusayn-i-Mara<u>gh</u>iyí</mark>, who obstinately
    refused to utter a single word despite the severe pressure that was brought to bear upon him. They tortured him, they resorted to every possible measure in
    order to extort from him any hint that could <a name="Page_446"></a>serve their purpose, but failed to achieve their end. Such was his unswerving obstinacy
    that his oppressors thought him to be dumb. They asked <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl</mark>, who had converted him to his Faith, whether or not he could talk. “He is mute,
    but not dumb,” he replied; “he is fluent of speech and is free from any impediment.” He had no sooner called him by his name than the victim answered,
    assuring him of his readiness to abide by his will.
<p></p>Convinced of their powerlessness to bend their will, they referred the matter to <mark class="term correct">Maḥmúd</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who, in his turn, submitted their case to the
<mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>,<a href="#_ftn459" name="_ftnref459" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>. The sovereign in those days refrained from direct interference in matters pertaining to the affairs of the persecuted community, and was often
    ignorant of the decisions that were being made with regard to its members. His Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> was invested with plenary powers to deal with them as he saw
    fit. No one questioned his decisions, nor dared disapprove of the manner in which he exercised his authority. He immediately issued a peremptory order
    threatening with execution whoever among these fourteen prisoners was unwilling to recant his faith. Seven were compelled to yield to the pressure that was
    brought to bear upon them, and were immediately released. The remaining seven constitute the Seven Martyrs of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>:
<p></p>1. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, surnamed <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>al-i-‘Aẓam</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>ál-i-A‘ẓam</mark>,<a href="#_ftn460" name="_ftnref460" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s
    maternal uncle, and one of the leading merchants of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. It was this same uncle into whose custody the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, after the death of His father, was
    entrusted, and who, on his Nephew’s return from His pilgrimage to <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark> and His arrest by <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, assumed undivided responsibility for Him by
    pledging his word in writing. It was he who surrounded Him, while under his care, with unfailing solicitude, who served Him with such devotion, and who
    acted as intermediary between Him and the hosts of His followers who flocked to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> to see Him. His only child, a <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Javád</mark>, died in infancy.
    Towards the middle of the year 1265 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn461" name="_ftnref461" title="">[************************************]</a><a name="Page_447"></a>this same <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> left <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> and visited the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in the castle of <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>. From thence he went to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and, though having
    no special occupation, remained in that city until the outbreak of the sedition which brought about eventually his martyrdom.
<p></p>Though his friends appealed to him to escape the turmoil that was fast approaching, he refused to heed their counsel and faced, until his last hour, with
    complete resignation, the persecution to which he was subjected. A considerable number among the more affluent merchants of his acquaintance offered to pay
    his ransom, an offer which he rejected. Finally he was brought before the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>. “The Chief Magistrate of this realm,” the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> informed him,
    “is loth to inflict the slightest injury upon the Prophet’s descendants. Eminent merchants of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> are willing, nay eager, to pay your
    ransom. The <mark class="term misspelled">Maliku’t-Tujjar</mark><mark class="term correction">Maliku’t-Tujjár</mark> has even interceded in your behalf. A word of recantation from you is sufficient to set you free and ensure your return, with
    honours, to your native city. I pledge my word that, should you be willing to acquiesce, the remaining days of your life will be spent with honour and
    dignity under the sheltering shadow of your sovereign.” “Your Excellency,” boldly replied <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, “if others before me, who quaffed
    joyously the cup of martyrdom, have chosen to reject an appeal such as the one you now make to me, know of a certainty that I am no less eager to decline
    such a request. My repudiation of the truths enshrined in this Revelation would be tantamount to a rejection of all the Revelations that have preceded it.
    To refuse to acknowledge the Mission of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> would be to apostatise from the Faith of my forefathers and to deny the Divine character of the
    Message which <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, Jesus, Moses, and all the Prophets of the past have revealed. God knows that whatever I have heard and read concerning the sayings
    and doings of those Messengers, I have been privileged to witness the same from this Youth, this beloved Kinsman of mine, from His earliest boyhood to
    this, the thirtieth year of His life. Everything in Him reminds me of His illustrious Ancestor and of the <mark class="term correct">imáms</mark> of His Faith whose lives our recorded
    traditions have portrayed. I only request of you that you allow me to be <a name="Page_448"></a>the first to lay down my life in the path of my beloved
    Kinsman.”
<p></p><p>The <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark> was stupefied by such an answer. In a frenzy of despair, and without uttering a word, he motioned that he be taken out and beheaded. As the victim
    was being conducted to his death, he was heard, several times, to repeat these words of <mark class="term misspelled">Háfiz</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥáfiẓ</mark>: “Great is my gratitude to Thee, O my God, for having granted
    so bountifully all I have asked of Thee.” “Hear me, O people,” he cried to the multitude that pressed around him; “I have offered myself up as a willing
    sacrifice in the path of the Cause of God. The entire province of <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark>, as well as <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, beyond the confines of Persia, will readily testify to my
    uprightness of conduct, to my sincere piety and noble lineage. For over a thousand years, you have prayed and prayed again that the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> be made
    manifest. At the mention of His name, how often have you cried, from the depths of your hearts: <mark class="term unknown">‘Hasten</mark>, O God, His coming; remove every barrier that
    stands in the way of His appearance!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> And now that He is come, you have driven Him to a hopeless exile in a remote and sequestered corner of <mark class="term unknown">Á<u>dh</u></mark>
    <mark class="term unknown">irbayján</mark> and have risen to exterminate His companions. Were I to invoke the malediction of God upon you, I am certain that His avenging wrath would
    grievously afflict you. Such is not, however, my prayer. With my last breath, I pray that the Almighty may wipe away the stain of your guilt and enable you
    to awaken from the sleep of heedlessness.”<a href="#_ftn462" name="_ftnref462" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a>
</p>These words stirred his executioner to his very depths. Pretending that the sword he had been holding in readiness in his hands required to be resharpened,
    he hastily went away, determined never to return again. “When I was appointed to this service,” he was heard to complain, weeping bitterly the while, “they
undertook to deliver into my hands only those who had been convicted of murder and highway robbery. I am now ordered by them to shed the blood of    <a name="Page_449"></a>one no less holy than the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Musay-i-Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Músáy-i-Káẓim</mark><a href="#_ftn463" name="_ftnref463" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a>
    himself!” Shortly after, he departed for <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> and there sought to earn his livelihood as a porter and crier. To the believers of that province,
    he recounted the tale of that tragedy, and expressed his repentance of the act which he had been compelled to perpetrate. Every time he recalled that
    incident, every time the name of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> was mentioned to him, tears which he could not repress flowed from his eyes, tears that were a
    witness to the affection which that holy man had instilled into his heart.
<p></p>2. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Qurbán-‘Alí</mark>,<a href="#_ftn464" name="_ftnref464" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> a native of <mark class="term misspelled">Barfurú<u>sh</u></mark><mark class="term correction">Bárfurú<u>sh</u></mark> in the province
    of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, and an outstanding figure in the community known by the name of <mark class="term misspelled">Ni’matu’lláhí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ni‘matu’lláhí</mark>. He was a man of sincere piety and endowed with great
    nobleness of nature. Such was the purity of his life that a considerable number among the notables of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> had pledged
    him their loyalty, and regarded him as the very embodiment of virtue. Such was the esteem in which he was held by his countrymen that, on the occasion of
his pilgrimage to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, a vast concourse of devoted admirers thronged his route in order to pay their homage to him. In <mark class="term correct">Hamadán</mark>, as well as in <mark class="term misspelled">Kirman</mark><mark class="term correction">Kirmán</mark><mark class="term unknown"><u>sh</u>áh</mark>, a great number of people were influenced by his personality and joined the company of his followers. Wherever he went, he was greeted with the
    acclamations of the people. These demonstrations of popular enthusiasm were, however, extremely distasteful to him. He avoided the crowd and disdained the
    pomp and circumstance of leadership. On his way to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, while passing through <mark class="term correct">Mandalíj</mark>, a <u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> of considerable influence became so
    enamoured of him that he renounced all that he had formerly cherished and, leaving his friends and disciples, followed him as far as <mark class="term misspelled">Ya’qubíyyih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ya‘qúbíyyih</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Qurbán-‘Alí</mark>, however, succeeded in inducing him to return to <mark class="term correct">Mandalíj</mark> and resume the work which he had abandoned.
<p></p>On his return from his pilgrimage, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Qurbán-‘Alí</mark> met <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and through him embraced the truth of the Cause. Owing to illness, he was unable to
    join the defenders <a name="Page_450"></a>of the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, and, but for his unfitness to travel to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, would have been the first to join its
    occupants. Next to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, among the disciples of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> was the person to whom he was most attached. During my visit to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, I was
    informed that the latter had consecrated his life to the service of the Cause and had risen with exemplary devotion to promote its interests far and wide.
    I often heard <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Qurbán-‘Alí</mark>, who was then in the capital, deplore that illness. “How greatly I grieve,” I heard him several times remark, “to have been
    deprived of my share of the cup which <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and his companions have quaffed! I long to join <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> and enrol myself under his banner and strive to
    make amends for my previous failure.” He was preparing to leave <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, when he was suddenly arrested. His modest attire witnessed to the degree of his
detachment. Clad in a white tunic, after the manner of the Arabs, cloaked in a coarsely woven <mark class="term correct">‘abá</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn465" name="_ftnref465" title="">[*************************************]</a> and wearing the <mark class="term unknown">head-dress</mark> of the people of <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, he seemed, as
    he walked the streets, the very embodiment of renunciation. He scrupulously adhered to all the observances of his Faith, and with exemplary piety performed
    his devotions. “The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> Himself conforms to the observances of His Faith in their minutest details,” he often remarked. “Am I to neglect on my part the
    things which are observed by my Leader?”
<p></p><p>When <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Qurbán-‘Alí</mark> was arrested and brought before the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark> <mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, a commotion such as <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> had rarely experienced was raised. Large crowds of people
    thronged the approaches to the headquarters of the government, eager to learn what would befall him. “Since last night,” the <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark>, as soon as he had seen
him, remarked, “I have been besieged by all classes of State officials who have vigorously interceded in your behalf.    <a href="#_ftn466" name="_ftnref466" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> From what I learn of the position you occupy and the influence
    your words exercise, you are not <a name="Page_451"></a>much inferior to the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> Himself. Had you claimed for yourself the position of leadership,
    better would it have been than to declare your allegiance to one who is certainly inferior to you in knowledge.” “The knowledge which I have acquired,” he
    boldly retorted, “has led me to bow down in allegiance before Him whom I have recognised to be my Lord and Leader. Ever since I attained the age of
    manhood, I have regarded justice and fairness as the ruling motives of my life. I have judged Him fairly, and have reached the conclusion that should this
    Youth, to whose transcendent power friend and foe alike testify, be false, every Prophet of God, from time immemorial down to the present day, should be
    denounced as the very embodiment of falsehood! I am assured of the unquestioning devotion of over a thousand admirers, and yet I am powerless to change the
    heart of the least among them. This Youth, however, has proved Himself capable of transmuting, through the elixir of His love, the souls of the most
    degraded among His fellow men. Upon a thousand like me He has, unaided and alone, exerted such influence that, without even attaining His presence, they
    have flung aside their own desires and have clung passionately to His will. Fully conscious of the inadequacy of the sacrifice they have made, these yearn
    to lay down their lives for His sake, in the hope that this further evidence of their devotion may be worthy of mention in His Court.”
</p><p>“I am loth,” the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark> <mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark> remarked, “whether your words be of God or not, to pronounce the sentence of death against the possessor of so exalted a
station.” “Why hesitate? burst forth the impatient victim. “Are you not aware that all names descend from Heaven? He whose name is <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>,<a href="#_ftn467" name="_ftnref467" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> in whose path I am laying down my life, has<a name="Page_452"></a>from time immemorial inscribed my name, <mark class="term correct">Qurbán-‘Alí</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn468" name="_ftnref468" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> in the scroll of His chosen martyrs. This is indeed the day on
    which I celebrate the <mark class="term correct">Qurbán</mark> festival, the day on which I shall seal with my <mark class="term unknown">life-blood</mark> my faith in His Cause. Be not, therefore, reluctant, and rest
    assured that I shall never blame you for your act. The sooner you strike off my head, the greater will be my gratitude to you.” “Take him away from this
    place!” cried the <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark>. “Another moment, and this dervish will have cast his spell over me!” “You are proof against that magic,” <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Qurbán-‘Alí</mark> replied,
    “that can captivate only the pure in heart. You and your like can never be made to realise the entrancing power of that Divine elixir which, swift as the
    twinkling of an eye, transmutes the souls of men.”
</p><p>Exasperated by the reply, the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark> <mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark> arose from his seat and, his whole frame shaking with anger, exclaimed: “Nothing but the edge of the sword can
    silence the voice of this deluded people!” “No need,” he told the executioners who were in attendance upon him, “to bring any more members of this hateful
    sect before me. Words are powerless to overcome their unswerving obstinacy. Whomever you are able to induce to recant his faith, release him; as for the
    rest, strike off their heads.”
</p><p>As he drew near the scene of his death, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Qurbán-‘Alí</mark>, intoxicated with the prospect of an approaching reunion with his Beloved, broke forth into
    expressions of joyous exultation. “Hasten to slay me,” he cried with rapturous delight, “for through this death you will have offered me the chalice of
    everlasting life. Though my withered breath you now extinguish, with a myriad lives will my Beloved reward me; lives such as no mortal heart can conceive!”
    “Hearken to my words, you who profess to be the followers of the Apostle of God,” he pleaded, as he turned his gaze to the concourse of spectators.
    “<mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, the <mark class="term unknown">Day-Star</mark> of Divine guidance, who in a former age arose above the horizon of <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark>, has <mark class="term unknown">to-day</mark>, in the person of <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark>, again risen
    from the <mark class="term unknown">Day-Spring</mark> of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, shedding the same radiance and imparting the same warmth. A rose is a rose in whichever garden, and at whatever time,
    it may bloom.” Seeing on <a name="Page_453"></a>every side how the people were deaf to his call, he cried aloud: “Oh, the perversity of this generation!
    How heedless of the fragrance which that imperishable Rose has shed! Though my soul brim over with ecstasy, I can, alas, find no heart to share with me itS
    charm, nor mind to apprehend its glory.”
</p><p>At the sight of the body of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, beheaded and bleeding at his feet, his fevered excitement rose to its highest pitch. “Hail,” he shouted
    as he flung himself upon it, “hail the day of mutual rejoicing, the day of our reunion with our Beloved!” “Approach,” he cried to the executioner, as he
    held the body in his arms, “and strike your blow, for my faithful comrade is unwilling to release himself from my embrace, and calls me to hasten together
    with him to the court of the <mark class="term unknown">Well-Beloved</mark>.” A blow from the executioner fell immediately upon the nape of his neck. A few moments later, and the soul of
    that great man had passed away. That cruel stroke stirred in the bystanders feelings of mingled indignation and sympathy. Cries of sorrow and lamentation
    ascended from the hearts of the multitude, and provoked a distress that was reminiscent of the outbursts of grief with which every year the populace greets
    the day of <mark class="term misspelled">A<u>sh</u>ura</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Á<u>sh</u>úrá</mark>.<a href="#_ftn469" name="_ftnref469" title="">[**************************************]</a>3. Then came the turn of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl-i-Qumí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl-i-Qumí</mark>, who was a native of <mark class="term unknown">Farahán</mark>. In his early youth, he departed for <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> In quest of the Truth which he
    was diligently striving to discover. He had associated with all the leading <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, had sat at the feet of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, and had
    acquired from him the knowledge and understanding which enabled him, a few years later when in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, to acknowledge the Revelation of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. He
distinguished himself by the tenacity of his faith and the fervour of his devotion. As soon as the injunction of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, bidding His<a name="Page_454"></a>followers hasten to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, reached him, he enthusiastically responded, joined the companions who were proceeding to Bada    <u>sh</u>t, and there received the appellation of <mark class="term misspelled">Sirru’l-Vujud</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sirru’l-Vujúd</mark>. Whilst in their company, his understanding of the Cause grew deeper and his zeal for its
    promotion correspondingly increased. He grew to be the very embodiment of detachment, and felt more and more impatient to demonstrate in a befitting manner
    the spirit with which his Faith had inspired him. In the exposition of the meaning of the verses of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> and the traditions of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, he displayed an
    insight which few could rival, and the eloquence with which he set forth those truths won him the admiration of his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>. In the days when the
    fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> had become the rallying centre for the disciples of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, he languished disconsolate upon a <mark class="term unknown">sick-bed</mark>, unable to lend his assistance and
    play his part for its defence. No sooner had he recovered than, finding that that memorable siege had ended with the massacre of his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>, he
    arose, with added determination, to make up by his <mark class="term unknown">self-sacrificing</mark> labours for the loss which the Cause had sustained. That determination carried him
    eventually to the field of martyrdom and won him its crown.
</p>Conducted to the block and waiting for the moment of his execution, he turned his gaze towards those twin martyrs who had preceded him and who still lay
    entwined in each other’s embrace. “Well done, beloved companions!” he cried, as he fixed his gaze upon their gory heads. “You have turned <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> into a
    paradise! Would that I had preceded you!” Drawing from his pocket a coin, which he handed to his executioner, he begged him to purchase for him something
    with which he could sweeten his mouth. He took some of it and gave the rest to him, saying: “I have forgiven you your act; approach and deal your blow. For
    thirty years I have yearned to witness this blessed day, and was fearful lest I should carry this wish with me unfulfilled to the grave.” “Accept me, O my
    God,” he cried, as he turned his eyes to heaven, “unworthy though I be, and deign to inscribe my name upon the scroll of those immortals who have laid down
    their lives on the altar of sacrifice.” He was <a name="Page_455"></a>still offering his devotions when the executioner, at his request, suddenly cut short
    his prayer.<a href="#_ftn470" name="_ftnref470" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a><p></p>4. He had hardly expired when <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Tur<u>sh</u>ízí</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark>, was conducted in his turn to the block. He was a native of <mark class="term unknown">Tur<u>sh</u>íz</mark>, a
    village in <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, and was highly esteemed for his piety and rectitude of conduct. He had studied for a number of years in <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark>, and was
    commissioned by his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-mujtahids</mark> to proceed to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> and there propagate the principles he had been taught. When he arrived at <mark class="term misspelled">Kazímayn</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓimayn</mark>, he
    met <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqíy-i-Kirmání</mark>, an old acquaintance of his, who ranked among the foremost merchants of <mark class="term correct">Kirmán</mark>, and who had opened a branch of his
    business in <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>. As he was on his way to Persia, he decided to accompany him. This <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark> had been a close friend of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s maternal uncle, through whom he had been converted to the Cause in the year 1264 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn471" name="_ftnref471" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> while preparing to leave <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> on a pilgrimage to
    <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. When informed of the projected journey of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> to <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark> for the purpose of visiting the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, he expressed his eager
    desire to accompany him. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> advised him to carry out his original purpose and proceed to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> and there await his letter, which
    would inform him whether it would be advisable to join him. From <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> was ordered to depart for <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, in the hope that
after a short stay in the capital he would be able to renew his visit to his Nephew. Whilst in <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, he expressed his reluctance to return to    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, inasmuch as he could no longer endure .the increasing arrogance of its inhabitants. <a name="Page_456"></a>Upon his arrival in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, he
    requested <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark> to join him. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> accompanied him from <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark> to the capital and through him was converted to the Faith.
<p></p>As he faced the multitude that had gathered round him to witness his martyrdom, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> raised his voice and said: “Hear me, O followers of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>! My
name is <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and I am a descendant of the <mark class="term misspelled">Siyyidu’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>uhada</mark><mark class="term correction">Siyyidu’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>uhadá’</mark>, who also bore that name.    <a href="#_ftn472" name="_ftnref472" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> The <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> of the holy cities of <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> have
    unanimously testified to my position as the authorised expounder of the law and teachings of their Faith. Not until recently had heard thee name of the
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>. The mastery I have obtained over the intricacies of the <mark class="term correct">Islámic</mark> teachings has enabled me to appreciate the value of the Message which the
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> has brought. I am convinced that, were I to deny the Truth which He has revealed, I should, by this very act, have renounced my allegiance to
    every Revelation that has preceded it. I appeal to every one of you to call upon the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> and <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> of this city and to convene a gathering, at
    which I will undertake in their presence to establish the truth of this Cause. Let them then judge whether I am able to demonstrate the validity of the
    claims advanced by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. If they be satisfied with the proofs which I shall adduce in support of my argument, let them desist from shedding the blood of
    the innocent; and if I fail, let them inflict upon me the punishment I deserve.” These words had scarcely dropped from his lips when an officer in the
    service of the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark> haughtily interjected: “I carry with me your <mark class="term unknown">death-warrant</mark> signed and sealed by seven of the recognised <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, who
    have in their own handwriting pronounced you an infidel. I will myself be answerable to God on the Day of Judgment for your blood, and will lay the
    responsibility upon those leaders in whose judgment we have been asked to put our trust and to whose decisions we have been compelled to submit.” With
    these words he drew out his dagger and stabbed him with such force that he immediately fell dead at his feet.
<p></p>5. Soon after, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqíy-i-Kirmání</mark> was led <a name="Page_457"></a>to the scene of execution. The ghastliness of the sight he beheld provoked his
    violent indignation. “Approach, you wretched and heartless tyrant,” he burst forth as he turned to his persecutor, “and hasten to slay me, for I am
    impatient to join my beloved <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. To live after him is a torture I cannot endure.”
<p></p><p>6. No sooner had <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark> uttered these words than <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Murtadá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Murtaḍá</mark>, who was one of the noted merchants of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, hastened to take precedence of
    his companions. He flung himself over the body of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>, and pleaded that, being a siyyid, his martyrdom would be more meritorious in the
    sight of God than that of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>. As the executioner <a name="Page_458"></a>unsheathed his sword, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Murtadá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Murtaḍá</mark> invoked the memory of his
    martyred brother, who had struggled side by side with <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>; and such were his references that the onlookers marvelled at the unyielding tenacity of
    the faith with which he was inspired.
</p>7. In the midst of the turmoil which the stirring words of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Murtadá</mark><mark class="term correction">Murtaḍá</mark> had raised, <mark class="term unknown">Muḥammad-Ḥusayn-i-Mara<u>gh</u>iyí</mark> rushed forward and begged that he
    be allowed to be martyred immediately ere his companions were put to the sword. As soon as his eyes fell upon the body of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl-i-Qumí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl-i-Qumí</mark>, for
    whom he entertained a deep affection, he impulsively threw himself upon him and, holding him in his embrace, exclaimed: “Never will I consent to separate
    myself from my dearly beloved friend, in whom I have reposed the utmost confidence and from whom I have received so many evidences of a sincere and
    <mark class="term unknown">deep-felt</mark> affection!”
<p></p><p>Their eagerness to precede one another in laying down their lives for their Faith astonished the multitude who wondered which of the three would be
    preferred to his companions. They pleaded with such fervour that eventually they were beheaded, all three, at one and the same moment.
</p>So great a faith, such evidences of unbridled cruelty, human eye has rarely beheld. Few as they were in number, yet when we recall the circumstances of
    their martyrdom, we are compelled to acknowledge the stupendous character of that force which could evoke so rare a spirit of <mark class="term unknown">self-sacrifice</mark>. When we
    remember the exalted rank these victims had occupied, when we observe the degree of their renunciation and the vitality of their faith, when we recall the
    pressure which from influential quarters had been exerted to avert the danger with which their lives were threatened, above all when we picture to our
    minds the spirit that defied the atrocities which a heartless enemy so far bemeaned themselves as to inflict upon them, we are impelled to look upon that
episode as one of the most tragic occurrences in the annals of this Cause.    <a href="#_ftn473" name="_ftnref473" title="">[***************************************]</a><a name="Page_459"></a>At this stage of my narrative I was privileged to submit to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> such sections of my work as I had already revised and completed. How abundantly
    have my labours been rewarded by Him whose favour alone I seek, and for whose satisfaction I have addressed myself to this task! He graciously summoned me
    to His presence and vouchsafed me His blessings. I was in my home in the <mark class="term unknown">prison-city</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Akká</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Akká</mark>, and lived in the neighbourhood of the house of <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark>,
when the summons of my Beloved reached me. That day, the seventh of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark><mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark> in the year 1306 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn474" name="_ftnref474" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> I shall never forget. I here reproduce the gist of His words to
    me on that memorable occasion:
<p></p>“In a Tablet which We yesterday revealed, We have explained the meaning of the words, <mark class="term unknown">‘Turn</mark> your eyes away,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn475" name="_ftnref475" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> in the course of Our reference to the circumstances attending
    the gathering at <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark>. We were celebrating, in the company of a number of distinguished notables, the nuptials of one of the princes of royal
    blood in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, when <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad-i-Yazdí</mark>, father of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s amanuensis, appeared suddenly at the door. He beckoned to Us, and seemed to
    be the bearer of an important message which he wished immediately to deliver. We were, however, unable at that moment to leave the gathering, and motioned
    to him to wait. When the meeting had dispersed, he informed <a name="Page_460"></a>Us that <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> had been placed in strict confinement in <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, and
    that her life was in great danger. We immediately summoned <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-Hádíy-i-Farhádí</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-Hádiy-i-Farhádí</mark>, and gave him the necessary directions to release her from her
    captivity, and escort her to the capital. As the enemy had seized Our house, We were unable to accommodate her indefinitely in Our home. Accordingly, We
arranged for her transference from Our house to that of the Minister of War,    <a href="#_ftn476" name="_ftnref476" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> who, in those days, had been disgraced by his sovereign and had
    been deported to <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>. We requested his sister, who still was numbered among Our friends, to act as hostess to <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>.
<p></p>“She remained in her company until the call of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, bidding Us proceed to <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, reached Our ears. We decided that <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> should proceed
    immediately to that province, and commissioned <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><a href="#_ftn477" name="_ftnref477" title="">[****************************************]</a> to conduct
    her to a place outside the gate of the city, and from thence to any locality she deemed advisable in that neighbourhood. She was taken to an orchard in the
    vicinity of which was a deserted building, where they found an old man who acted as its caretaker. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Músá</mark> returned and informed Us of the reception
    which had been accorded to them, and highly praised the beauty of the surrounding landscape. We subsequently arranged for her departure for <u>Kh</u><mark class="term unknown">urásán</mark>, and promised that We would follow within the space of a few days.
<p></p>“We soon joined her at <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark>, where We rented a garden for her use, and appointed the same <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Hádí</mark> who had achieved her deliverance, as her
    doorkeeper. About seventy of Our companions were with Us and lodged in a place in the vicinity of that garden.
<p></p>“We fell ill one day, and were confined to bed. <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> sent a request to call upon Us. We were surprised at her message, and were at a loss as to what We
should reply. Suddenly We saw her at the door, her face unveiled before Us. How well has <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ján</mark><a href="#_ftn478" name="_ftnref478" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> commented upon that incident. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> face of <mark class="term misspelled">Fátimih</mark><mark class="term correction">Fáṭimih</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he said,
    <mark class="term unknown">‘must</mark> needs be revealed on the Day of Judgment and appear unveiled before the eyes of men. At that moment the voice of the Unseen <a name="Page_461"></a>shall be heard saying: “Turn your eyes away from that which ye have seen.”
<p></p><p>“How great was the consternation that seized the companions on that day! Fear and bewilderment filled their hearts. A few, unable to tolerate that which
    was to them so revolting a departure from the established customs of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, fled in horror from before her face. Dismayed, they sought refuge in a deserted
castle in that neighbourhood. Among those who were scandalised by her behaviour and severed from her entirely were the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Nahrí</mark>    <a href="#_ftn479" name="_ftnref479" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> and his brother <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Hádí</mark>, to both of whom We sent word that
    it was unnecessary for them to desert their companions and seek refuge in a castle.
</p>“Our friends eventually dispersed, leaving Us at the mercy of Our enemies. When, at a later time, We went to <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark>, such was the turmoil which the people
    had raised that above four thousand persons had congregated in the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> and had crowded onto the roofs of their houses. The leading <mark class="term correct">mullá</mark> of the town
    denounced Us bitterly. <mark class="term unknown">‘You</mark> have perverted the Faith of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he cried in his <mark class="term unknown">mázindarání</mark> dialect, <mark class="term unknown">‘and</mark> sullied its fame! Last night I saw you in a dream
    enter the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>, which was thronged by an eager multitude that had gathered to witness your arrival. As the crowd pressed round you, I beheld, and, lo,
    the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> was standing in a corner with His gaze fixed upon your countenance, His features betraying great surprise. This dream I regard as evidence of
    your having deviated from the path of Truth.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> We assured him that the expression of surprise on that countenance was a sign of the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>’s strong
    disapproval of the treatment he and his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-townsmen</mark> had accorded Us. He questioned Us regarding the Mission of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. We informed him that, although
    We had never met Him face to face, yet We cherished, none the less, a great affection for Him. We expressed Our profound conviction that He had, under no
    circumstances, acted contrary to the Faith of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>.
<p></p>The <mark class="term correct">mullá</mark> and his followers, however refused to believe Us, and rejected Our testimony as a perversion of the truth. They eventually placed Us in
    confinement, and forbade Our <a name="Page_462"></a>friends to meet Us. The acting governor of <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark> succeeded in effecting Our release from captivity.
    Through an opening in the wall that he ordered his men to make, he enabled Us to leave that room, and conducted Us to his house. No sooner were the
    inhabitants informed of this act than they arose against Us, besieged the governor’s residence, pelted Us with stones, and hurled in Our face the foulest
    invectives.
<p></p>“At the time We proposed to send <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-Hádíy-i-Farhádí</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-Hádiy-i-Farhádí</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, in order to achieve the deliverance of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> and conduct her to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, <u>Sh</u>ay    <u>kh</u><mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark> wrote Us, insisting that such an attempt was fraught with grave risks and might occasion an unprecedented tumult. We refused to be
    deflected from Our purpose. That <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> was a <mark class="term unknown">kind-hearted</mark> man, was simple and lowly in temper, and behaved with great dignity. He lacked
    courage and determination, however, and betrayed weakness on certain occasions.”
<p></p><p>A word should now be added regarding the closing stages of the tragedy that witnessed to the heroism of the Seven Martyrs of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. For three days and
    three nights they remained abandoned in the <mark class="term correct">Sabzih-Maydán</mark>, which adjoined the imperial palace, exposed to untold indignities which an unrelenting foe
    heaped upon them. Thousands of devout <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ahs</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ahs</mark> gathered round their corpses, kicked them with their <a name="Page_463"></a>feet, and spat upon their
    faces. They were pelted, cursed, and mocked by the angry multitude. Heaps of refuse were flung upon their remains by the bystanders, and the foulest
    atrocities were perpetrated upon their bodies. No voice was raised in protest, no hand was stretched to stay the arm of the barbarous oppressor.
</p>Having allayed the tumult of their passion, they buried them outside the gate of the capital, in a place which lay beyond the limits of the public
    cemetery, adjoining the moat, between the gates of <mark class="term correct">Naw</mark> and of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-‘Aẓím</mark>. They were all laid in the same grave, thus remaining united in
body, as they had been in spirit during the days of their earthly life.    <a href="#_ftn480" name="_ftnref480" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><p></p>The news of their martyrdom came as an added blow to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, who was already plunged in sorrow at the fate that had befallen the heroes of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. In the
    detailed Tablet He revealed in their honour, every word of which testified to the exalted position they occupied in His eyes, He referred to them as those
    very “Seven Goats” spoken of in the traditions of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, who on the Day of Judgment shall “walk in front of the promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>.” They shall symbolise by
    their life the noblest spirit of heroism, and by their death shall manifest true acquiescence in His will. By preceding the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> explained, is
    meant that their martyrdom will precede that of the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> Himself, who is their Shepherd. What the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had predicted came to be fulfilled, inasmuch as His
    own martyrdom occurred four months later in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>.
<p></p>That memorable year witnessed, in addition to the martyrdom of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and that of His seven companions in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, the momentous happenings of <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> which
    culminated in the death of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>. Towards the end of that same year, <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> likewise became the centre of a storm which raged with exceptional violence
    throughout the surrounding district, bringing in its wake the massacre of a vast number of <a name="Page_464"></a>the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s staunchest disciples. That
    year, rendered memorable by the magnificent heroism which those staunch supporters of His Faith displayed, not to speak of the marvellous circumstances
    that attended His own martyrdom, must ever remain as one of the most glorious chapters ever recorded in that Faith’s <mark class="term unknown">blood-stained</mark> history. The entire face
    of the land was blackened by the atrocities in which a cruel and rapacious enemy freely and persistently indulged. From <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, on the eastern
    confines of Persia, as far west as <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, the scene of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s martyrdom, and from the northern cities of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> stretching south as far as
    <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, in the province of <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark>, the whole country was enveloped in darkness, a darkness that heralded the dawning light of the Revelation which the
expected <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was soon to manifest, a Revelation mightier and more glorious than that which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> Himself had proclaimed.    <a href="#_ftn481" name="_ftnref481" title="">[*]</a><a name="Page_465"></a>CHAPTER XXII: THE <mark class="term correct">NAYRÍZ</mark> UPHEAVALIN THE early days of the siege of the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> was engaged in spreading the teachings of the Cause in <mark class="term correct">Burújird</mark> as well as in the province of
    <mark class="term unknown">Kurdistán</mark>. He had resolved to win the majority of the inhabitants of those regions to the Faith of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and had intended to proceed from thence to <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark>
    and there continue his labours. As soon as he had learned of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>’s departure for <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, he hastened to the capital and undertook the
    necessary preparations for his journey to the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. He was preparing to leave, when <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> arrived from <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> and informed him of the
    impossibility of joining his brethren. He was greatly saddened at this news, and his only consolation in those days was to visit <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> frequently,
    and to obtain the benefit of His wise and priceless counsels.<a href="#_ftn482" name="_ftnref482" title="">[†]</a><p></p><mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> eventually determined to proceed to <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> and to resume the work in which he had been engaged. From thence he left for <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>, where
    he met his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> and was able to stimulate their enthusiasm and reinforce their efforts. He continued his journey to <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>, to <mark class="term correct">Ardistán</mark> and
    <mark class="term correct">Ardikán</mark>, and in each of these cities he proclaimed, with zest and fearlessness, the fundamental teachings of his Master and succeeded in winning over a
    considerable <a name="Page_466"></a>number of able supporters to the Cause. He reached <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark> in time to celebrate the festivities of <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark> with his
    brethren, who expressed their joy at his arrival and were greatly encouraged by his presence among them. Being a man of renowned influence, he possessed,
    in addition to his house in <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>, where his wife and her four sons had settled, a home in <mark class="term unknown">Daráb</mark>, which was the abode of his ancestors, and another one in
    <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, which was superbly furnished.
<p></p>He arrived at <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark> on the first day of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádiyu’l-Avval</mark><mark class="term correction">Jamádíyu’l-Avval</mark>, in the year 1266 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn483" name="_ftnref483" title="">[‡]</a> the fifth
    day of which, the anniversary of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s Declaration, coincided with the feast of <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>. The leading <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> and notables of the city all came on that
    day to greet him and to offer their best wishes. <mark class="term unknown">Navváb-i-Radaví</mark>, the meanest and most prominent among his adversaries, was present on that occasion, and
    maliciously hinted at the extravagance and splendour of that reception. “The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s imperial banquet,” he was heard to remark, “can scarcely hope to
    rival the sumptuous repast you have spread before us. I suspect that in addition to this national festival which <mark class="term unknown">to-day</mark> we are celebrating, you commemorate
another one besides it.” <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>’s bold and sarcastic retort provoked the laughter of those who were present. All applauded, in view of the avarice    <a name="Page_467"></a>and wickedness of the <mark class="term correct">Navváb</mark>, the appropriateness of his remark. The <mark class="term correct">Navváb</mark>, who had never encountered the ridicule of so large and
    distinguished a company, was stung by that answer. The smouldering fire which he nourished in his mind against his opponent now blazed forth with added
    intensity, and impelled him to satisfy his thirst for revenge.
<p></p><mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> seized the occasion to proclaim, fearlessly and without reserve, in that gathering, the basic principles of his Faith, and to demonstrate their
    validity. The majority of those who heard him were but partially acquainted with the distinguishing features of the Cause, and were ignorant of its full
    import. Certain ones among them were irresistibly attracted, and readily embraced it; the rest, unable to challenge its claims publicly, denounced it in
    their hearts and swore to extirpate it by every means in their power. His eloquence and fearless exposition of the Truth inflamed their hostility and
    strengthened their determination to seek, without delay, the overthrow of his influence. That very day witnessed the combination of their forces against
him, and marked the beginning of an episode that was destined to bring in its wake so much suffering and distress.    <a href="#_ftn484" name="_ftnref484" title="">[§]</a><p></p>To destroy the life of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> became the paramount object of their activity. They spread the news that, on the day of <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark>, in the midst of the assembled
    dignitaries of the city, both civil and ecclesiastical, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Yaḥyáy-i-Darábí</mark><mark class="term correction">Yaḥyáy-i-Dárábí</mark> had had the temerity to unveil the challenging features of the Faith of the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and had adduced, for the purpose of his argument, proofs and evidences gleaned both from the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> and from the traditions of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. “Though his
    listeners,” they urged, “ranked among the most illustrious of the <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> of the city, no one could be found in that assemblage to venture a protest
    against his vehement assertions of the <a name="Page_468"></a>claims of his creed. The silence kept by those who heard him has been responsible for the
    wave of enthusiasm which has swept over the city in his favour, and has brought no less than half of its inhabitants to his feet, while the remainder are
    being fast attracted.”
<p></p><p>This report spread like wildfire throughout <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark> and the surrounding district. It kindled, on the one hand, the flame of bitter hatred, and, on the other,
    was instrumental in adding considerable numbers to those who had already identified themselves with that Faith. From <mark class="term correct">Ardikán</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled">Man<u>sh</u>ad</mark> <mark class="term correction">Man<u>sh</u>ád</mark>, as well as
    from the more distant towns and villages, crowds of people, eager to hear of the new Message, flocked to the house of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>. “What are we to do?” they
    asked him. “In what manner do you advise us to show forth the sincerity of our faith and the intensity of our devotion?” From morning till night, <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> was
    absorbed in resolving their perplexities and in directing their steps in the path of service.
</p>For forty days, this feverish activity persisted on the part of his zealous supporters, both men and women. His house had become the rallying centre of an
    innumerable host of devotees who yearned to demonstrate worthily the spirit of the Faith that had fired their souls. The commotion that ensued provided the
    <mark class="term unknown">Navváb-i-Radaví</mark> with a fresh pretext for enlisting the support of the governor of the city,<a href="#_ftn485" name="_ftnref485" title="">[**]</a> who was
    young and inexperienced in the affairs of State, in his efforts against his adversary. He soon fell a victim to the intrigues and machinations of that evil
    plotter, who succeeded in inducing him to despatch a force of armed men to besiege the house of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>. While a regiment of the army was proceeding to that
    spot, a mob composed of the degraded elements of the city were, at the instigation of the <mark class="term correct">Navváb</mark>, directing their steps towards that same place, determined
    by their threats and imprecations to intimidate its occupants.
<p></p>Though hemmed in by hostile forces on every side, <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> continued, from the window of the upper floor of his house, to animate the zeal of his supporters
and to clarify whatever remained obscure in their minds. At the sight of a whole regiment, reinforced by an infuriated mob, preparing to attack    <a name="Page_469"></a>them, they turned to <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> in their distress and begged him to direct their steps. “This very sword that lies before me,” was his
    answer, as he remained seated beside the window, “was given me by the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> Himself. God knows, had I been authorised by Him to wage holy warfare against
    this people, I would, alone and unaided, have annihilated their forces. I am, however, commanded to refrain from such an act.” “This very steed,” he added,
    as his eyes fell upon the horse which his servant <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> had saddled and brought to the front of his house, “the late <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> gave me, that
    with it I might undertake the mission with which he entrusted me, of conducting an impartial investigation into the nature of the Faith proclaimed by the
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>. He asked me to report personally to him the results of my enquiry, inasmuch as I was the only one among the ecclesiastical leaders of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>
    in whom he could repose implicit confidence. I undertook that mission with the firm resolution of confuting the arguments of that siyyid, of inducing Him
    to abandon His ideas and to acknowledge my leadership, and of conducting Him with me to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> as a witness to the triumph I was to achieve. When I came
    into His presence, however, and heard His words, the opposite of that which I had imagined took place. In the course of my first audience with Him, I was
    utterly abashed and confounded; by the end of the second, I felt as helpless and ignorant as a child; the third found me as lowly as the dust beneath His
    feet. He had indeed ceased to be the contemptible siyyid I had previously imagined. To me, He was the manifestation of God Himself, the living embodiment
    of the Divine Spirit. Ever since that day, I have yearned to lay down my life for His sake. I rejoice that the day I have longed to witness is fast
    approaching.”
<p></p><p>Seeing the agitation that had seized his friends, he exhorted them to be calm and patient, and to rest assured that the omnipotent Avenger would ere long
    inflict, with His own invisible hand, a crushing defeat upon the forces arrayed against His loved ones. No sooner had he uttered these words than the news
arrived that a certain <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Abdu’lláh</mark>, whom no one suspected of being still alive, had suddenly emerged with a number of his comrades, who had    <a name="Page_470"></a>likewise disappeared from sight, and, raising the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!”<a href="#_ftn486" name="_ftnref486" title="">[††]</a>
    had flung themselves upon their assailants and dispersed their forces. He displayed such courage that the whole detachment, abandoning their arms, had
    sought refuge, together with the governor, in the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Narin</mark> <mark class="term correction">Nárín</mark>.
</p>That night, <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-’Abdu’llah</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-‘Abdu’lláh</mark> asked to be introduced into the presence of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>. He assured him of his <a name="Page_471"></a>faith in the Cause, and
    acquainted him with the plans he had conceived of subjugating the enemy. “Although your intervention,” <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> replied, “has <mark class="term unknown">to-day</mark> averted from this house
    the danger of an unforeseen calamity, yet you must recognise that until now our contest with these people was limited to an argument centering round the
    Revelation of the <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>. The <mark class="term correct">Navváb</mark>, however, will henceforth be induced to instigate the people against us, and will contend that I have arisen
    to establish my undisputed sovereignty over the entire province and intend to extend it over the whole of Persia.” <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> advised him to leave the city
    immediately, and to commit him to the care and protection of the Almighty. “Not until our appointed time arrives,” he assured him, “will the enemy be able
    to inflict upon us the slightest injury.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-’Abdu’llah</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-‘Abdu’lláh</mark>, however, preferred to ignore the advice of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>. “It would be cowardly of me,” he was heard to remark as he retired, “to abandon my
friends to the mercy of an irate and murderous adversary. What, then, would be the difference between me and those who forsook the <mark class="term unknown">Siyyidu’<u>sh</u></mark>-    <u>Sh</u>uhada<a href="#_ftn487" name="_ftnref487" title="">[‡‡]</a> on the day of <mark class="term misspelled">A<u>sh</u>ura</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Á<u>sh</u>úrá</mark>,<a href="#_ftn488" name="_ftnref488" title="">[§§]</a> and
    left him companionless on the field of <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>? A merciful God will, I trust, be indulgent towards me and will forgive my action.”
</p><p>With these words, he directed his steps to the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Narin</mark> <mark class="term correction">Nárín</mark> and compelled the forces that had massed in its vicinity to seek an inglorious refuge within
    the walls of the fort; and succeeded in keeping the governor confined along with those who were besieged. He himself kept watch, ready to intercept
    whatever reinforcements might seek to reach them.
</p>Meanwhile the <mark class="term correct">Navváb</mark> had succeeded in raising a general upheaval in which the mass of the inhabitants took part. They were preparing to attack the house of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> when he summoned <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">‘Abdu’l-’Azim-i-<u>Kh</u>ú’í</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abdu’l-‘Aẓím-i-<u>Kh</u>u’í</mark>, surnamed the <mark class="term misspelled">Siyyid-i-<u>Kh</u>al-Dar</mark><mark class="term correction">Siyyid-i-<u>Kh</u>ál-Dár</mark>, who had participated for a few days in the defence of
    the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, and whose dignity of bearing attracted widespread attention, and bade him mount his own steed and address publicly, through the
    streets and <a name="Page_472"></a>bazaars, an appeal on his behalf to the entire populace, and urge them to embrace the Cause of the <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>. “Let
    them know,” he added, “that I disclaim any intention of waging holy warfare against them. Let them be warned, however, that if they persist in besieging my
    house and continue their attacks upon me, in utter defiance of my position and lineage, I shall be constrained, as a measure of <mark class="term unknown">self-defence</mark>, to resist and
    disperse their forces. If they choose to reject my counsel and yield to the whisperings of the crafty <mark class="term correct">Navváb</mark>, I will order seven of my companions to
    repulse their forces shamefully and to crush their hopes.”
<p></p><p>The <mark class="term misspelled">Siyyid-i-<u>Kh</u>al-Dar</mark> <mark class="term correction">Siyyid-i-<u>Kh</u>ál-Dár</mark> leaped upon the steed and, escorted by four of his chosen brethren, rode out through the market and pealed out, in accents of
    compelling majesty, the warning he had been commissioned to proclaim. Not content with the message with which he had been entrusted, he ventured to add, in
    his own inimitable manner, a few words by which he sought to heighten the effect which the proclamation had produced. “Beware,” he thundered, “if you
    despise our plea. My lifted voice, I warn you, will prove sufficient to cause the very walls of your fort to tremble, and the strength of my arm will be
    capable of breaking down the resistance of its gates!”
</p><p>His stentorian voice rang out like a trumpet, and diffused consternation in the hearts of those who heard it. With one voice, the affrighted population
    declared their intention to lay down their swords and cease to molest <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, whose lineage they said they would henceforth recognise and respect.
</p>Constrained by the blank refusal of the people to fight against <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Navváb</mark> induced them to direct their attack against <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-’Abdu’llah</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-‘Abdu’lláh</mark> and his
    comrades, who were stationed in the neighbourhood of the fort. The clash of these forces induced the governor to sally from his refuge and to instruct the
    besieged detachment to join hands with those who had been recruited by the <mark class="term correct">Navváb</mark>. <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-’Abdu’llah</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-‘Abdu’lláh</mark> had begun to disperse the mob that had rushed forth
    from the city against him, when he was suddenly assailed by the fire which the troops opened upon him by order of the governor. A bullet struck his foot
    and threw him to the ground. A number of his supporters were also <a name="Page_473"></a>wounded. His brother hurriedly got him away to a place of safety,
    and from thence carried him, at his request, to the house of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>.
<p></p>The enemy followed him to that house, fully determined to seize and slay him. The clamour of the people that had massed around his house compelled <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> to
    order <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-Riḍáy-i-Man<u>sh</u>adí</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-Riḍáy-i-Man<u>sh</u>ádí</mark>, one of the most enlightened <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Man<u>sh</u>ad</mark><mark class="term correction">Man<u>sh</u>ád</mark>, who had discarded his turban and offered himself as
    his doorkeeper, to sally forth and, with the aid of six companions, whom he would choose, to scatter their forces. “Let each one of you raise his voice,”
    he commanded them, “and repeat seven times the words <mark class="term misspelled">‘Alláh-u-Akbar</mark><mark class="term correction">Alláh-u-Akbar</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn489" name="_ftnref489" title="">[***]</a> and on your seventh invocation
    spring forward at one and the same moment into the midst of your assailants.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Riḍá</mark>, whom <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had named <mark class="term misspelled">Rada’r-Rúh</mark> <mark class="term correction">Raḍa’r-Ruḥ</mark>, sprang to his feet and, with his companions, straightway proceeded to fulfil the instructions
    he had received. Those who accompanied him, though frail of form and inexperienced in the art of swordsmanship, were fired with a faith that made them the
terror of their adversaries. Seven of the most redoubtable among the enemy perished that day, which was the <mark class="term unknown">twenty-seventh</mark> of the month of <mark class="term unknown">Jamádiyu’</mark>    <mark class="term unknown"><u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark>.<a href="#_ftn490" name="_ftnref490" title="">[†††]</a> “No sooner had we routed the enemy,” <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Riḍá</mark> related, “and
    returned to the house of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, than we found <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-’Abdu’llah</mark> <mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-‘Abdu’lláh</mark> lying wounded before us. He was carried to our leader, and partook of the food with which
    the latter had been served. Afterwards he was borne to a hiding place, where he remained concealed until he recovered from his wound. Eventually he was
    seized and slain by the enemy.”
</p><p>That very night, <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> bade his companions disperse and exercise the utmost vigilance to secure their safety. He advised his wife to remove, with her
    children and all their belongings, to the home of her father, and to leave behind whatever was his personal property. “This palatial residence,” he
    informed her, “I have built with the sole intention that it should be eventually demolished in the path of the Cause, and the stately furnishings with
    which I have adorned it have been purchased in the hope that one day I shall be <a name="Page_474"></a>able to sacrifice them for the sake of my Beloved.
    Then will friend and foe alike realise that he who owned this house was endowed with so great and priceless a heritage that an earthly mansion, however
    sumptuously adorned and magnificently equipped, had no worth in his eyes; that it had sunk, in his estimation, to the state of a heap of bones to which
    only the dogs of the earth could feel attracted. Would that such compelling evidence of the spirit of renunciation were able to open the eyes of this
    perverse people, and to stir in them the desire to follow in the steps of him who showed that spirit!”
</p><p>In the <mark class="term unknown">mid-watches</mark> of that same night, <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> arose and, collecting the writings of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> that were in his possession, as well as the copies of all the
    treatises that he himself had composed, entrusted them to his servant <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, and ordered him to convey them to a place outside the gate of the city where
    the road branches off to <mark class="term correct">Mihríz</mark>. He bade him await his arrival, and warned him that, were he to disregard his instructions, he would never again be able to
    meet him.
</p>No sooner had <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> mounted his horse and prepared to leave than the cries of the sentinels, who kept watch at the entrance of the fort, reached his ears.
    Fearing lest they should capture him and seize the precious manuscripts in his possession, he decided to follow a different route from the one which his
    master had instructed him to take. As he was passing behind the fort, the sentinels recognised him, shot his horse, and captured him.
<p></p>Meanwhile <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> was preparing to depart from <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>. Leaving his two sons, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark>, in the care of their mother, he left,
    accompanied by his two other sons, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark>, together with two of his companions who were both residents of <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark> and had asked
    permission to accompany him on his journey. The first, who was named <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Gh</u>ulam-Riḍá</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Gh</u>ulám-Riḍá</mark>, was a man of exceptional courage, while the latter, <u>Gh</u><mark class="term unknown">ulam-Riḍáy-i-Kuchík</mark>, had distinguished himself in the art of marksmanship. He chose the same route that he had advised his servant to take, and, arriving
    safely at that spot, was surprised to find that <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> was missing. <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> knew immediately that he had disregarded his directions and had been captured by
    the <a name="Page_475"></a>enemy. He deplored his fate, and was reminded of the action of <mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-’Abdu’llah</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-‘Abdu’lláh</mark>, who had similarly acted against his will and
had in consequence suffered injury. They were subsequently informed that on the morning of that same day <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> was blown from the mouth of a cannon    <a href="#_ftn491" name="_ftnref491" title="">[‡‡‡]</a> and that a certain <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, who had been the <mark class="term correct">imám</mark> of one of the quarters of <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>, and who was a
    man of renowned piety, had an hour later also been captured and subjected to the same fate as his comrade.
<p></p>The departure of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> from <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark> roused the enemy to fresh exertions. They rushed to his house, plundered his possessions, and demolished it completely.    <a href="#_ftn492" name="_ftnref492" title="">[§§§]</a> He himself was meanwhile directing his steps towards <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>. Though unaccustomed to walking, he
    covered, that night, seven <mark class="term correct">farsangs</mark><a href="#_ftn493" name="_ftnref493" title="">[****]</a> on foot, while his sons were carried part of the way by his two
    companions. In the course of the ensuing day, he concealed himself within the recesses of a neighbouring mountain. As soon as his brother, who resided in
    that vicinity and entertained a deep affection for him, was informed of his arrival, he secretly despatched to him whatever provisions he required. That
    same day a body of the governor’s mounted attendants, who had set out in pursuit of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, arrived at that village, searched the house of his brother,
    where they suspected that he was concealed, and appropriated a large amount of his property. Unable to find him, they retraced their steps to <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark>.
<p></p><mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, in the meantime, made his way through the mountains until he reached the district of <mark class="term misspelled">Bavanat-i-Fárs</mark><mark class="term correction">Bavánát-i-Fárs</mark>. Most of its inhabitants, who were numbered
    among his fervent admirers, readily embraced the Cause, among whom was the <a name="Page_476"></a><mark class="term unknown">well-known</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl</mark>, the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term unknown">u’l-Islám</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Bavánat</mark><mark class="term correction">Bavánát</mark>. A considerable number of these people accompanied him as far as the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Fasa</mark><mark class="term correction">Fasá</mark>, where the inhabitants refused to respond to the
    Message which he invited them to follow.
<p></p>All along his route, wherever he tarried, <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>’s first thought, as soon as he had dismounted, was to seek the neighbouring <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>, wherein he would summon
    the people to hear him announce the tidings of the New Day. Utterly oblivious of the fatigues of his journey, he would promptly ascend the pulpit and
    fearlessly proclaim to his congregation the character of the Faith he had risen to champion he would spend only one night in that place if he had succeeded
    in winning to the Cause souls upon whom he could rely to propagate it after his departure. Otherwise he would straightway resume his march and refuse
    further to associate with them. “Through whichever village I pass,” he often remarked, “and fail to inhale from its inhabitants the fragrance of belief,
    its food and its drink are both distasteful to me.”
<p></p><p>Arriving at the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Runiz</mark> <mark class="term correction">Rúníz</mark>, in the district of <mark class="term misspelled">Fasa</mark> <mark class="term correction">Fasá</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> decided to tarry for a few days. Those hearts which he found receptive to his call he
    strove to attract and to inflame with the fire of God’s love. As soon as the news of his arrival reached <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, the entire population of the <u>Ch</u>
    <mark class="term unknown">inár-Su<u>kh</u>tih</mark> quarter hastened out to meet him. People from other quarters likewise, impelled by their love and admiration for him, decided to join
    them. Fearing lest <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark> <mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the governor of <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, should object to their visit, the majority of them set out at night. From the
    quarter of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Ch</u>inár-Su<u>kh</u>tih</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Ch</u>inár-Sú<u>kh</u>tih</mark> alone more than a hundred students, preceded by their leader, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">‘Abdu’l-Alí</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Abdu’l-‘Alí</mark>, the
    <mark class="term unknown">father-in-law</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, and a judge of recognised standing throughout that district, were moved to join a number of the most distinguished among the
    notables of <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> in greeting the expected visitor ere his arrival at their town. Among these figured <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Ḥusayn</mark>, a venerable man of eighty who
was highly esteemed for his piety and learning; <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Báqir</mark>, who was the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> of the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Ch</u>inár-Su<u>kh</u>tih</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Ch</u>inár-Sú<u>kh</u>tih</mark> quarter; <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Qutb</mark>, the kad-    <mark class="term unknown"><u>kh</u>udá’</mark><a href="#_ftn494" name="_ftnref494" title="">[††††]</a> of the <mark class="term correct">Bázár</mark> quarter, <a name="Page_477"></a>with all his relatives; <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark>, a relative of the governor; <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>, who has been mentioned by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in the “<mark class="term misspelled">Suriy-i-Ayyúb</mark> <mark class="term correction">Súriy-i-Ayyúb</mark>,” together with his <mark class="term unknown">son-in-law</mark>;
    <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Nawrá</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Riḍá</mark>, both of the <mark class="term misspelled">Sadat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sádát</mark> quarter.<a href="#_ftn495" name="_ftnref495" title="">[‡‡‡‡]</a>
</p>All of these, some by day and others by night, went as far as the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Runiz</mark><mark class="term correction">Rúníz</mark> in order to extend their welcome to the visitor, and to assure him of
    their unalterable devotion. Although the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had revealed a general Tablet addressed specially to those who had newly embraced His Cause in <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, yet its
    recipients remained ignorant of its significance and fundamental principles. It was given to <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> to enlighten them regarding its true purpose and set
    forth its distinguishing features.
<p></p>No sooner had <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> been made aware of the considerable exodus that had taken place for the purpose of welcoming the arrival of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>,
    than he despatched a special messenger to overtake and inform those who had already departed of his determination to take the life, capture the wives, and
    confiscate the property of everyone who persisted in giving allegiance to him. Not one of those who departed heeded the warning, but rather did they cling
    still more passionately to their leader. Their unyielding determination and disdainful neglect of his messenger filled the governor with dismay. Fearful
    lest these should arise against him, he decided to transfer his residence to the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Qutrih</mark><mark class="term correction">Quṭrih</mark>, where his original home had been, and which lay at a
    distance of eight <mark class="term correct">farsangs</mark><a href="#_ftn496" name="_ftnref496" title="">[§§§§]</a> from <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>. He chose that <a name="Page_478"></a>village because in its
    vicinity there stood a massive fortress which he could utilise as a place of refuge in case of danger. He was, moreover, assured that its inhabitants were
    trained in the art of marksmanship and could be relied upon whenever summoned to defend him.
<p></p><mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> had meanwhile left <mark class="term misspelled">Runiz</mark><mark class="term correction">Rúníz</mark> for the shrine of <mark class="term correct">Pír-Murád</mark>, which was situated outside the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Istahbanat</mark><mark class="term correction">Iṣṭáhbánát</mark>. Despite the interdiction pronounced by
    the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of that village against his admittance, no less than twenty of its inhabitants went out to welcome him, and accompanied him as far as <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>.
    When they arrived, in the forenoon of the fifteenth of <mark class="term correct">Rajab</mark>,<a href="#_ftn497" name="_ftnref497" title="">[*****]</a> the first thing <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> did, as soon
    as he reached his native quarter of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Ch</u>inár-Su<u>kh</u>tih</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Ch</u>inár-Sú<u>kh</u>tih</mark>, even before going to his own house, was enter the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> and summon the congregation that
    had gathered to acknowledge and embrace the Message of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. Impatient to face the multitude that awaited him, still wearing his <mark class="term unknown">dust-laden</mark> garments, he
ascended the pulpit and spoke with such convincing eloquence that the whole audience was electrified by his appeal.<a href="#_ftn498" name="_ftnref498" title="">[†††††]</a> No less than a thousand persons, all natives <a name="Page_479"></a>of the <mark class="term unknown"><u>Ch</u>inár-Su</mark><u>kh</u>tih quarter, and five hundred others from other sections of <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, all of whom had thronged the building, spontaneously responded. “We have heard
    and we obey!” cried, with unrestrained enthusiasm, the jubilant multitude, as they came forward to assure him of their homage and gratitude. The spell
    which that impassioned address threw over the hearts of those who heard it was such as <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> had never before experienced. “My sole purpose,” <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> went
    on, explaining to his audience, as soon as the first flush of excitement had subsided, “in coming to <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> is to proclaim the Cause of God. I thank and
    glorify Him for having enabled me to touch your hearts with His Message. No need for me to tarry any longer in your midst, for if I prolong my stay, I fear
    that the governor will <mark class="term unknown">ill-treat</mark> you because of me. He may seek reinforcement <a name="Page_480"></a>from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> and destroy your homes and subject
    you to untold indignities.” “We are ready and resigned to the will of God,” answered, with one voice, the congregation. “God grant us His grace to
    withstand the calamities that may yet befall us. We cannot, however, reconcile ourselves to so abrupt and hasty a separation from you.”
<p></p><p>No sooner had these words escaped their lips than men and women joined hands in conducting <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> triumphantly to his home. Wild with excitement and
    exultant with joy, they pressed round him and, with cheers and acclamations, escorted him to the very entrance of his house.
</p>The few days <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> consented to tarry in <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> were spent mostly in the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>, where he continued with his customary <a name="Page_481"></a>eloquence and
    without the least reservation to propound the fundamental teachings which he had received from his Master. Every day witnessed an increase in the number of
    his audience, and from every side evidences of his marvellous influence became more and more manifest.
<p></p>The fascination which he exerted over the people could not fail to fan to fury the dormant hostility of <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. He was roused to new
    exertions, and gave orders that an army be raised for the avowed purpose of eradicating a Cause which he felt was fast undermining his own position. He
    soon succeeded in recruiting about a thousand men, consisting of both cavalry and infantry, all of whom were well trained in the art of warfare and were
    equipped with an ample store of munitions. His plan was, by a sudden onset, to make him a prisoner.
<p></p><mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, as soon as he was informed of the designs of the governor, ordered those twenty companions who had left <mark class="term misspelled">Istahbanat</mark><mark class="term correction">Iṣṭáhbánát</mark> to welcome him, and who had
    accompanied him as far as <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, to occupy the fort of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>ájih</mark>, which was situated in the vicinity of the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Ch</u>inár-Su<u>kh</u>tih</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Ch</u>inár-Sú<u>kh</u>tih</mark> quarter. He
    appointed <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Hádí</mark>, son of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥsin</mark>, as the leader of the band, and urged his followers who resided in that quarter to
    fortify the gates, the turrets, and the walls of that stronghold.
<p></p>The governor had meanwhile transferred his seat to his own house in the <mark class="term correct">Bázár</mark> quarter. The force he had raised accompanied him and occupied the fort
situated in its vicinity. Its towers and walls, which he began to reinforce, overlooked the whole town. Having compelled <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abú-Talíb</mark><mark class="term correction">Abú-Ṭálib</mark>, the kad-    <mark class="term unknown"><u>kh</u>udá</mark><a href="#_ftn499" name="_ftnref499" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡]</a> of that quarter and one of the companions of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, to evacuate his house, he
    fortified its roof and, stationing upon it a number of his men, under the command of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, he gave orders to open fire upon his
    adversary. The first to suffer was that same <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Ḥusayn</mark> who, despite his advanced age, had walked out to welcome <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>. He was offering his
    prayer on the roof of his house when a bullet struck his right foot, causing him to bleed profusely. That cruel blow evoked the sympathy of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, who
    hastened, in a written message to the sufferer, <a name="Page_482"></a>to express his grief at the injury he had sustained, and to cheer him with the
    thought that he, at this advanced stage of his life, was the first to be chosen to fall a victim in the path of the Cause.
<p></p>The suddenness of the attack dismayed a number of the companions who had hastily embraced the Message and had failed to appreciate its full meaning. Their
    faith was so severely shaken that a few were induced, in the dead of night, to separate themselves from their companions and join forces with the enemy.
    <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> had no sooner been informed of their action than he arose at the hour of dawn and, mounting his steed and accompanied by a number of his supporters,
    rode out to the fort of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>ájih</mark>, where he fixed his residence.
<p></p>His arrival was the signal for a fresh attack upon him. <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> immediately despatched his elder brother, <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Aṣ<u>gh</u>ar</mark><u>Kh</u><mark class="term unknown">án</mark>, together with a thousand men, all armed and well trained, to lay siege to that fort, in which <mark class="term unknown">seventy-two</mark> companions had already taken shelter. At the
    hour of sunrise, a certain number of them, acting in accordance with the instructions or <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, sallied forth, and with extraordinary rapidity forced the
    besiegers to disperse.
<p></p>No more than three of the companions met their death in the course of that encounter. The first was <mark class="term misspelled">Taju’d-Din</mark><mark class="term correction">Táju’d-Dín</mark>, a man renowned for his fearlessness, whose
    business was the manufacture of the woollen <mark class="term correct">kuláh</mark>;<a href="#_ftn500" name="_ftnref500" title="">[§§§§§]</a> the second was <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynil</mark><mark class="term correction">Zayníl</mark>, son of <mark class="term correct">Iskandar</mark>, who was
    an agriculturist by profession; the third was <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark>, who was a man of distinguished merit.
<p></p>This complete and sudden rout aroused the apprehensions of Prince <mark class="term correct">Fírúz</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Nusratu’d-Dawlih</mark><mark class="term correction">Nuṣratu’d-Dawlih</mark>, governor of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, who gave orders for the
    prompt extermination of the occupants of the fort. <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> despatched one of the prince’s attendants to <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, urging him, in view of
    the strained relations between them, to depart from <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, in the hope that the mischief that had been kindled might soon be extinguished. “Tell him,”
    replied <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, “that my two children, together with their two attendants, are all the company I have with me. If my presence in this town will cause
    mischief, I am willing to depart why is it that, instead <a name="Page_483"></a>of according us the welcome which befits a descendant of the Prophet, he
    has deprived us of water and has incited his men to besiege and attack us? If he persists in denying us the necessities of life, I warn him that seven of
    my companions, whom he regards as the most contemptible among men, will inflict upon his combined forces a humiliating defeat.”
<p></p><p>Finding that <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark> <mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> ignored his warning, <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> ordered his companions to emerge from the fort and punish their assailants. With
    admirable courage and confidence, they succeeded, though extremely young in years, and utterly inexperienced in the use of arms, in demoralising a trained
    and organised army. <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Aṣ<u>gh</u>ar</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> himself perished, and two of his sons were captured. <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark> <mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> disgracefully retreated,
    with what still remained of his scattered forces, to the village of <mark class="term misspelled">Qutrih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Quṭrih</mark>, acquainted the prince with the gravity of the situation, and begged him to send
    immediate reinforcements, stressing in particular the need for heavy artillery and a large detachment of both infantry and cavalry.
</p><mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, on his part, finding that the enemy was bent on their extermination, gave orders that the defences of the fort be strengthened, that a <mark class="term unknown">water-cistern</mark>
    be constructed within its enclosure, and that the tents they had carried away be pitched outside its gates. That day certain of his companions had assigned
    to them special functions and duties. <mark class="term correct">Karbilá’í</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> was made the gatekeeper of the fort; <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Yúsúf</mark><mark class="term correction">Yúsuf</mark>, the custodian of the funds;
    <mark class="term correct">Karbilá’í</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, son of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>amsu’d-Dín</mark>, the superintendent of the gardens adjoining the fort and its barricades; <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, the uncle of
<mark class="term correct">‘Alíy-i-Sardár</mark>, was appointed the officer in charge of the tower of the mill known by the name of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Ch</u>inar</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Ch</u>inár</mark>, situated in the vicinity of the fort;    <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í-i-<u>Sh</u>ivih-Ka<u>sh</u></mark> to be the executioner; <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-Ja’far</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-Ja‘far</mark>, cousin of <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the chronicler; <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Fadlu’lláh</mark><mark class="term correction">Faḍlu’lláh</mark> as the reader of these records; <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>hadí</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Taqí-Baqqal</mark><mark class="term correction">Taqí-Baqqál</mark> to be the gaoler; <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, the registrar; and <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Gh</u>ulam-Riḍáy-i-Yazdí</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Gh</u>ulám-Riḍáy-i-Yazdí</mark> to
    be the captain of the forces. In addition to the <mark class="term unknown">seventy-two</mark> companions who were with him within the fort and had accompanied him <a name="Page_484"></a>from <mark class="term misspelled">Istahbanat</mark><mark class="term correction">Iṣṭáhbánát</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> was induced, at the instance of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far-i-Yazdí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ja‘far-i-Yazdí</mark>, a <mark class="term unknown">well-known</mark> divine, and <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-‘Alí</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>’s
    <mark class="term unknown">father-in-law</mark>, to admit to the fort a number of the residents of the <mark class="term correct">Bázár</mark> quarter, together with several of his own kindred.
<p></p><mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> again renewed his appeal to the prince, and enclosed this time with his petition, which pleaded for urgent and adequate
    reinforcements, the sum of five thousand <mark class="term misspelled">túmans</mark><mark class="term correction">túmáns</mark><a href="#_ftn501" name="_ftnref501" title="">[******]</a> as his personal gift to him. He entrusted his
    letter to one of his intimate friends, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Báqir</mark>, allowed him to mount his own steed, and instructed him to deliver it in person to the prince. He chose
    him for his intrepidity, his fluency of speech, and tactfulness. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Báqir</mark> took an unfrequented route, and after a day’s journey reached a place called
    Huda<u>sh</u>tak, in the neighbourhood of which was a fort around which tribes who roved the country sometimes pitched their tents.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Báqir</mark> dismounted near one of these tents, and whilst he was talking with its occupants, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl</mark>, the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>u’l-Islám</mark> of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Bavánat</mark><mark class="term correction">Bavánát</mark>, arrived. He had obtained leave from <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> to proceed to his native village on some urgent affair, and to return immediately to <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>. After his
    lunch, he saw that a richly caparisoned horse was tethered to the ropes of one of the neighbouring tents. Being informed that it belonged to one of the
    friends of <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who had arrived from <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> and was on his way to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl</mark>, who was a man of exceptional
    courage, immediately went to that tent, mounted the horse, and, unsheathing his sword, sternly spoke these words to the owner of the tent with whom <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Báqir</mark> was still conversing: “Arrest this scoundrel, who has fled from before the face of the <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn502" name="_ftnref502" title="">[††††††]</a> Tie his hands and deliver him to me.” Affrighted by the words and manner of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl</mark>,
    the occupants of the tent immediately obeyed. They bound his hands and delivered the rope with which they had tied him to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl</mark>, who spurred
    on his charger in the direction of <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> and compelled his captive to follow him. At a distance of two <mark class="term correct">farsangs</mark> from that town, he reached the village of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Rastaq</mark><mark class="term correction">Rastáq</mark> and delivered his <a name="Page_485"></a>captive into the hands of its <mark class="term correct">kad-<u>kh</u>udá</mark>, whose name was <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Akbar</mark>, urging that he be conducted into
    the presence of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>. When brought before him, the latter enquired as to the purpose of his journey to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, to which he gave a frank and
    detailed reply. Though <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> was willing to forgive him, yet <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Báqir</mark>, by reason of his attitude towards him, was eventually put to death at the hands
    of the companions.
<p></p><mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, far from relaxing in his determination to solicit the aid he needed from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, appealed this time with increased
    vehemence to the prince, begging him to redouble his efforts for the extermination of what he regarded as the gravest menace to the security of his
    province. Not content with his earnest entreaty, he despatched to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> a number of his trusted men, whom he loaded with presents for the prince,
    hoping thereby to induce him to act with promptness. In a further effort to ensure the success of his endeavours, he addressed several appeals to the
    leading <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> and siyyids of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, wherein he glaringly misrepresented the aims of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, expatiated upon his subversive activities, and urged
    them to intercede with the prince and entreat him to expedite the despatch of reinforcements.
<p></p>The prince readily granted their request. He instructed <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’lláh</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>ujá’u’l-Mulk</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>ujá‘u’l-Mulk</mark>, to set out at once for <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, accompanied by
    the <mark class="term unknown">Hamadání</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled">Sila<u>kh</u>úrí</mark><mark class="term correction">Sílá<u>kh</u>urí</mark> regiments, headed by several officers, and provided with an adequate force of artillery. He, moreover, instructed his
    representative in <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> to recruit all the <mark class="term unknown">able-bodied</mark> men from the surrounding district, including the villages of <mark class="term misspelled">Istahbanat</mark><mark class="term correction">Iṣṭáhbánát</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Íraj</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Panj-Ma’adin</mark><mark class="term correction">Panj-Ma‘ádin</mark>,
    <mark class="term misspelled">Qutrih</mark><mark class="term correction">Quṭrih</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>sh</u>nih</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Dih-<u>Ch</u>áh</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mu<u>sh</u>kán</mark>, and <mark class="term misspelled">Rastaq</mark><mark class="term correction">Rastáq</mark>. To these he added the members of the tribe known by the name of <mark class="term misspelled">Visbaklaríyyih</mark><mark class="term correction">Vísbaklaríyyih</mark>, whom
    he commanded to join the army of <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>.
<p></p>An innumerable host suddenly surrounded the fort in which <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> and his companions were besieged, and began to dig trenches around it and to set up
barricades along those trenches.<a href="#_ftn503" name="_ftnref503" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> No sooner was the work accomplished than they    <a name="Page_486"></a>opened fire on them. A bullet struck the house on which one of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>’s attendants was riding as he was keeping watch at the gate.
    Another bullet followed immediately upon the first, and penetrated the turret above that gate. In the course of that bombardment, one of the companions,
    aiming with his rifle at the officer in charge of the artillery, shot him dead instantly, as a result of which the roar of the guns was immediately
    silenced. The assailants meanwhile retreated and hid themselves within their trenches. That night neither the besieged nor those who attacked them ventured
    to sally forth from their places of shelter.
<p></p>The second night, however, <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> summoned <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Gh</u>ulam-Riḍáy-i-Yazdí</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Gh</u>ulám-Riḍáy-i-Yazdí</mark> and instructed him, together with fourteen of his companions, to sally forth from the
    fort and drive off the enemy. Those who were called upon to perform that task were for the most part men of advanced age, whom no one would have thought
    capable of bearing the brunt of so fierce a struggle. Among them was a shoemaker who, though more than ninety years of age, showed such enthusiasm and
    vigour as no youth could hope to exceed. The rest of the fourteen were mere lads, as yet wholly unprepared to face the perils and endure the strain which
    such a sally entailed. Age, however, to those heroes, whom a dauntless will and an immovable confidence in the high destiny of their Cause had wholly
    transformed, mattered but little. They were instructed by their leader to divide immediately after they left the cover of the fort and, raising
    simultaneously the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Alláh-u-Akbar</mark>!”<a href="#_ftn504" name="_ftnref504" title="">[§§§§§§]</a> to spring into the midst of the enemy.
<p></p>No sooner had the signal been given than they arose and, hurrying to their steeds and rifles, marched out of the gate of the fort. Undaunted by the fire
    which spouted from the mouths of the cannons and by the bullets which rained upon their heads, they plunged headlong into the midst of their adversaries.
    This sudden encounter lasted for no less than eight hours, during which that fearless band was able to demonstrate such skill and bravery as amazed the
    veterans in the ranks of the enemy. From the town of <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, as well as from its surrounding fortifications reinforcements rushed to the aid of the small
    company that had withstood so valiantly <a name="Page_487"></a>the combined forces of a whole army. As the scope of the struggle extended, the voices of
    the women of <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, who had rushed to the roofs of their houses to acclaim the heroism which was being so strikingly displayed, were raised from every
    side. Their exulting cheers swelled the roar of the guns, which acquired added intensity by the shout of “<mark class="term correct">Alláh-u-Akbar</mark>!” which the companions, in a frenzy
    of excitement, raised amidst that tumult. The uproar caused by their womenfolk, their amazing audacity and <mark class="term unknown">self-confidence</mark>, utterly demoralised their
    opponents and paralysed their efforts. The camp of the enemy was desolate and forsaken, and offered a sad spectacle as the victors retraced their steps to
    the fort. They carried with them, in addition to those who were grievously wounded, no less than sixty dead, among whom were the following:
<p></p>1. <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Gh</u>ulam-Riḍáy-i-Yazdí</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Gh</u>ulám-Riḍáy-i-Yazdí</mark> (not to be confounded with the captain of the forces who bore the same name),

<p></p>So complete a failure convinced <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> and his staff of the futility of their efforts to compel, in an open contest, the submission of
    their adversaries.<a href="#_ftn505" name="_ftnref505" title="">[*******]</a> As was the case with the army of Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, who had miserably
    failed to subdue his opponents fairly in the field, treachery and fraud proved eventually the sole weapons with which a cowardly people could conquer an
    invincible enemy. By the devices to which <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> and his staff eventually resorted, they betrayed their powerlessness, despite the vast
    resources at their disposal and the moral support which the governor of <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark> and the inhabitants of the whole province had extended to them, to vanquish
    what to outward appearance seemed but a handful of untrained and contemptible people. In their hearts, they were convinced that behind the walls of that
    fort were clustered a band of volunteers which no force at their command could face and defeat.
<p></p>By raising the cry of peace, they sought, through such base cunning, to beguile those pure and noble hearts. For a few days they suspended all manner of
    hostility, after which they addressed a solemn and written appeal to the besieged, which in substance ran as follows: “Hitherto, as we were ignorant of the
    true character of your Faith, we have allowed the <mark class="term unknown">mischief-makers</mark> to induce us to believe that every one of you has violated the sacred precepts of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>.
    Therefore did we arise against you, and have endeavoured to extirpate your Faith. During the last few days, we have been made aware of the fact that your
    activities are untinged by any political motive, that none of you cherish any inclination to subvert the foundations of the State. We also have been
    convinced of the fact that your teachings do not involve any grave departure from the fundamental teachings of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. All that you seem to uphold is the
    claim that a man has <a name="Page_489"></a>appeared whose words are inspired and whose testimony is certain, and whom all the followers of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> must
    recognise and support. We can in no wise be convinced of the validity of this claim unless you consent to repose the utmost confidence in our sincerity,
    and accept our request to allow certain of your representatives to emerge from the fort and meet us in this camp, where we can, within the space of a few
    days, ascertain the character of your belief. If you prove yourselves able to demonstrate the true claims of your Faith, we too will readily embrace it,
    for we are not the enemies Truth, and none of us wish to deny it. Your leader we have always recognised as one of the ablest champions of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, and we
    regard him as our example and guide. This <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, to which we affix our seals, is the witness to the integrity of our purpose. Let that holy Book decide
    whether the claim you advance is true or false. The malediction of God and His Prophet rest upon us if we should attempt to deceive you. Your acceptance of
    our invitation will save a whole army from destruction, whilst your refusal will leave them in suspense and doubt. We pledge our word that as soon as we
    are convinced of the truth of your Message, we shall strive to display the same zeal and devotion you already have so strikingly manifested. Your friends
    will be our friends, and your enemies our enemies. Whatever your leader may choose to command, the same we pledge ourselves to obey. On the other hand, if
    we fail to be convinced of the truth of your claim, we solemnly promise that we shall in no wise interfere with your safe return to the fort, and shall be
    willing to resume our contest against you. We entreat you to refuse to shed more blood before attempting to establish the truth of your Cause.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> received the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> with great reverence and kissed it devoutly. “Our appointed hour has struck,” he remarked. “Our acceptance of their invitation
    will surely make them feel the baseness of their treachery.” “Though I am well aware of their designs,” he added, as he turned to his companions, “I feel
    it my duty to accept their call and take the opportunity to attempt once again to unfold the verities of my beloved Faith.” He bade them continue to
    discharge their duties, and place no reliance whatever on <a name="Page_490"></a>what their adversaries might profess to believe. He, moreover, ordered
    them to suspend all manner of hostilities until further notice from him.
</p>With these words he bade farewell to his companions and, accompanied by five attendants, among whom were <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alíy-i-Mu<u>dh</u>ahhib</mark> and the treacherous
    <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abid</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Ábid</mark>, set out for the camp of the enemy. <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, accompanied by <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>ujá’u’l-Mulk</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>ujá‘u’l-Mulk</mark> and all the members of his staff,
    came out to welcome him. They ceremoniously received him, conducted him to a tent that had been specially pitched for his reception, and introduced him to
    the rest of the officers. He seated himself upon a chair, while the rest of the company, with the exception of <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, <u>Sh</u><mark class="term unknown">ujá’u’l-Mulk</mark>, and another officer, whom he motioned to be seated, all stood before him. The words in which he addressed them were such that even a
    <mark class="term unknown">stone-hearted</mark> man could not fail to feel their power. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, in the “<mark class="term unknown">Súriy-Sabr</mark>,” has immortalised that noble appeal and revealed the full measure of
    its significance. “I am come to you,” <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> declared, “armed with the testimony with which my Lord has entrusted me. Am I not a descendant of the Prophet
    of God? Wherefore should you have risen to slay me? For what reason have you pronounced my <mark class="term unknown">death-sentence</mark>, and refused to recognise the undoubted rights
    with which my lineage has invested me?”
<p></p><p>The majesty of his bearing, combined with his penetrating eloquence, confounded his hearers. For three days and three nights, they lavishly entertained him
    and treated him with marked respect. In their congregational prayer, they invariably followed his lead, and attentively listened to his discourse. Though
    outwardly they seemed to be bowing to his will, yet they were secretly plotting against his life and were conspiring to exterminate the remnant of his
    companions. They knew full well that, were they to inflict upon him the least injury while his companions remained entrenched behind the walls of their
    fort, they would be exposing themselves to a peril still greater than the one they had already been compelled to face. They trembled at the fury and
    vengeance of their women no less than at the bravery and skill of their men. They realised that all the resources of <a name="Page_491"></a>the army had
    been powerless to subdue a handful of immature lads and decrepit old men. Nothing short of a bold and <mark class="term unknown">well-conceived</mark> stratagem could ensure their ultimate
    victory. The fear that filled their hearts was to a great extent inspired by the words of <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark> <mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who, with unrelaxing determination,
    sought to maintain undiminished the hatred with which he had inflamed their souls. <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>’s repeated exhortations had aroused his apprehensions lest he
    should succeed, by the magic of his words, in inducing them to transfer their allegiance to so eloquent an opponent.
</p><mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> and his friends at last decided to request <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> to address in his own handwriting a message to his companions who were still
    within the fort, to inform them that an amicable settlement of their differences had been effected, and to urge them either to join him at the headquarters
    of the army or to return to their homes. Though reluctant to give his assent to such a request, <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> was eventually forced to submit. In addition to this
    message, he confidentially informed his companions, in a second letter, of the evil designs of the enemy, and warned them not to allow themselves to be
    deceived. He entrusted both letters to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abid</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Ábid</mark>, instructing him to destroy the former and deliver the latter to his companions. He charged him,
    moreover, to urge them to choose the ablest among their number, and to sally forth in the dead of night and scatter the forces of the enemy.
<p></p>No sooner had <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abid</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Ábid</mark> received these directions than he treacherously communicated them to <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. The latter immediately
    sought to induce him to urge the occupants of the fort, in the name of their leader, to disperse, promising that he would in return abundantly reward him.
    The disloyal messenger delivered the first letter to <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>’s companions, and informed them that their leader had succeeded in winning over to his Faith the
    entire army, and that in view of this conversion he had advised them to leave for their homes.
<p></p>Though extremely bewildered by such a message, the companions felt unable to disregard the wishes <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> had so clearly expressed. They reluctantly
    dispersed, leaving all the fortifications unguarded. Obedient to the commands <a name="Page_492"></a>Illustrations: THE <mark class="term misspelled">MASJID-I-JAMI’</mark><mark class="term correction">MASJID-I-JÁMI‘</mark> AT <mark class="term correct">NAYRÍZ</mark>, WHERE <mark class="term misspelled">VAHÍD</mark><mark class="term correction">VAḤÍD</mark> ADDRESSED THE CONGREGATION] <a name="Page_493"></a>written by their leader, several of them
    discarded their arms, and directed their steps towards <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>.
<p></p><mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, anticipating the immediate evacuation of the fort, despatched a detachment of his forces to intercept their entry into the
    town. They were soon encompassed by a multitude of armed men, who were being continually reinforced from the army’s headquarters. Finding themselves thus
    unexpectedly hemmed in, they determined by every means in their power to repulse the attack and gain the <mark class="term misspelled">Masjid-i-Jami’</mark><mark class="term correction">Masjid-i-Jámi‘</mark> as swiftly as possible. By the aid
    of swords and rifles which some of them were carrying, others with sticks and stones only, they sought to force their way to the town. The cry of
    “<mark class="term correct">Alláh-u-Akbar</mark>!”<a href="#_ftn506" name="_ftnref506" title="">[†††††††]</a> rose again, fiercer and more compelling than ever. A few among them suffered
    martyrdom, as they forced their way through the ranks of their treacherous assailants. The rest, though wounded and harassed by fresh reinforcements which
    had beset them from every side, eventually succeeded in attaining the shelter of the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>.
<p></p>Meanwhile the notorious <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, the son of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>, an officer in the army of <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, succeeded, together with his
    men, in outdistancing his opponents and, concealing himself in one of the minarets of that <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>, lay in wait for the fugitives. No sooner had the
    scattered band approached the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> than he opened fire upon them. A certain <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> recognised him and, raising the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Alláh-u-Akbar</mark>!” scaled
    the minaret, aimed his rifle at that cowardly officer, and hurled him to the ground. His friends carried him away to a place where he was enabled to
    recover from his wound.
<p></p>The companions, unable any longer to obtain shelter in the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark>, were compelled to hide in whatever place of safety they could find, until such time as
    they might ascertain the fate of their leader. Their first thought after their betrayal was to seek his presence and follow whatever instructions he might
    wish to give them. They were, however, unable to discover what had befallen him, and trembled at the thought that he might have been put to death.
<p></p>Meanwhile <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> and his staff, emboldened <a name="Page_494"></a>by the dispersal of the companions, were strenuously exerting
    themselves to discover means whereby they could evade the obligations of their solemn oath and proceed unhindered to slay their chief opponent. They
    endeavoured by some specious device to set aside their sacred promises and to hasten the fulfilment of a <mark class="term unknown">long-cherished</mark> desire. In the midst of their
    deliberations, <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, a man notorious for his ruthlessness and cruelty, assured his comrades that if the thought of having taken that oath
    perplexed them, he himself had in no wise participated in that declaration, and was ready to execute what they felt unable to perform. “I can arrest at any
    time,” he burst forth in a fit of indignation, “and put to death whomever I deem guilty of having violated the laws of the land.” He immediately afterwards
    called upon all those whose kinsmen had perished to execute the sentence of death pronounced against <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>. The first to present himself was <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark>,
    whose brother <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Báqir</mark> had been captured by the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>u’l-Islám</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Bavánat</mark><mark class="term correction">Bavánát</mark>; the next was a man named <mark class="term misspelled">Safar</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣafar</mark>, whose brother <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>a’bán</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>a‘bán</mark>
    had perished; the third was <mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, whose father, <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Aṣ<u>gh</u>ar</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, elder brother of <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, had suffered the
    same fate.
<p></p>In their eagerness to carry out the suggestion of <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, these men snatched the turban from the head of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, wound it around his neck,
    and, binding him to a horse, dragged him ignominiously through the streets.<a href="#_ftn507" name="_ftnref507" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> The indignities that
    were heaped upon him reminded those who witnessed that awful spectacle of the tragic end of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, whose body was abandoned to the mercy of an
    infuriated enemy, and upon which a multitude of horsemen pitilessly trampled. The women or <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, stirred to the highest pitch of excitement by the shouts
    of triumph which a murderous enemy was raising, pressed from every side around the corpse, and, to the accompaniment of drums and cymbals, gave free vent
    to their feelings of unrestrained fanaticism. <a name="Page_495"></a>They danced merrily around it, scornful of the words which <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, in the midst of his
    agony, had spoken, words which the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, in a former age and in similar circumstances, had uttered: “Thou knowest, O my Beloved, that I have
    abandoned the world for Thy sake, and have placed my trust in Thee alone. I am impatient to hasten to Thee, for the beauty of Thy countenance has been
    unveiled to my eyes. Thou dost witness the evil designs which my wicked persecutor has cherished against me. Nay, never will I submit to his wishes or
    pledge my allegiance to him.”
<p></p><p>Thus was brought to an end a noble and heroic life. Such an eventful and brilliant career, distinguished by such vast learning,    <a href="#_ftn508" name="_ftnref508" title="">[§§§§§§§]</a> such dauntless courage, and so rare a spirit of <mark class="term unknown">self-sacrifice</mark>, surely required for crown a
    death as glorious as that which completed his martyrdom.<a href="#_ftn509" name="_ftnref509" title="">[********]</a> The extinction of that life was the
    signal for a fierce onslaught on the lives and property of those who had identified themselves with his Faith. No less than five thousand men were
    commissioned for that villainous task. The men were seized, chained, <mark class="term unknown">ill-treated</mark>, and eventually slaughtered. The women and children were captured and
    subjected to brutalities which no pen dare describe. Their property was confiscated, and their houses were destroyed. The fort of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>ájih</mark> was burned
to the ground. The majority of the men were first conducted in chains to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, and there, for the most part, suffered a cruel death.    <a href="#_ftn510" name="_ftnref510" title="">[††††††††]</a> Those whom <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark> <mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, for purposes <a name="Page_496"></a>of personal
    benefit, had plunged into dark and subterranean dungeons were, as soon as his object had been achieved, delivered into the hands of his myrmidons, who
    perpetrated upon them acts of unspeakable cruelty.<a href="#_ftn511" name="_ftnref511" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> They were paraded at first through the
    streets of <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, after which they were subjected to atrocious treatment in the hope of extracting from them whatever material advantage their persecutors
    had hitherto been unable to obtain. These having satisfied their greed, each victim was made to suffer an agonising death. Every instrument of torture
    their executioners could devise was utilised to quench their thirst for revenge. They were branded, their nails were pulled out, their bodies were lashed,
    an incision was made in the nose through which a string was driven, nails were hammered into their hands and feet, and in that piteous state each of them
    was dragged through the streets, an object of contempt and derision to all the people.
</p>Among them was a certain <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far-i-Yazdí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ja‘far-i-Yazdí</mark>, who in former days had exercised immense influence and had been <a name="Page_497"></a>Illustrations: SITE OF MARTYRDOMS AT <mark class="term correct">NAYRÍZ</mark>; GRAVES OF MARTYRS AT <mark class="term correct">NAYRÍZ</mark>] <a name="Page_498"></a>greatly honoured by the people. So great was the respect
    they owed him that <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> gave him precedence over himself and treated him with extreme deference and courtesy. He gave orders that the
    turban of that same man be befouled and flung into the fire. Shorn of the emblem of his lineage, he was exposed to the eyes or the public, who marched
    before him and overwhelmed him with abuse and ridicule.<a href="#_ftn512" name="_ftnref512" title="">[§§§§§§§§]</a><p></p>Another victim of their tyranny was <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark>, who had enjoyed, in days past, such a reputation for honesty and justice that his opinion was
    invariably regarded by the judges of the court as the determining word in their judgment. So great and esteemed a man was, in the depth of winter, stripped
    of his clothes, thrown into a pond, and lashed severely. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far</mark><mark class="term correction">Ja‘far</mark> and <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-‘Alí</mark>, who <a name="Page_499"></a>was <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>’s

    doomed to suffer the same fate. While they were exposed to the cold, the scum of the people was hired to heap upon their shivering bodies abominable
    cruelties. Many a poor man, who hastened to obtain the reward promised for this vile deed, revolted when informed of the nature of the task he was called
    upon to perform, and, rejecting the money, turned away with loathing and contempt.<a href="#_ftn513" name="_ftnref513" title="">[*********]</a>The day of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>’s martyrdom was the eighteenth of the month of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>a’bán</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>a‘bán</mark>, in the year 1266 A.H. Ten days later, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was shot in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>.    <a name="Page_500"></a>CHAPTER XXIII: MARTYRDOM OF THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>THE tale of the tragedy that marked the closing stages of the <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> upheaval spread over the length and breadth of Persia and kindled a startling
    enthusiasm in the hearts of those who heard it. It plunged the authorities of the capital into consternation and nerved them to a resolve of despair. The
    <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, was particularly overawed by these recurrent manifestations of an indomitable will, of a fierce
    and inflexible tenacity of faith. Though the forces of the imperial army had everywhere triumphed, though the companions of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> had
    successively been mowed down in a ruthless carnage at the hands of its officers, yet to the shrewd minds of the rulers of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> it was clear and evident
    that <a name="Page_501"></a>the spirit responsible for such rare heroism was by no means vanquished, that its might was far from broken. The loyalty which
    the remnants of that scattered band bore to their captive Leader still remained unimpaired. Nothing had as yet been successful, despite the appalling
    losses they had sustained, in sapping that loyalty or in undermining that faith. Far from being extinguished, that spirit had blazed more intense and
    devastating than ever. Galled by the memory of the indignities they had suffered, that persecuted band clung ever more passionately to its Faith and looked
    with increasing fervour and hope to its Leader.<a href="#_ftn514" name="_ftnref514" title="">[†††††††††]</a> Above all, He who had kindled that flame and
    nourished that spirit was still alive, and, despite His isolation, was able to exercise the full measure of His influence. Even a sleepless vigilance had
    been powerless to stem the tide that had swept over the entire face of the land, and which had as its motive force the continued existence of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>.
    Extinguish that light, choke the stream at its very source, and the torrent that had brought so much devastation in its wake would run dry. Such was the
    thought that swayed the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>. To do Him to death seemed to that foolish minister the most efficacious means for the
recovery of his country from the shame into which he thought it had sunk.<a href="#_ftn515" name="_ftnref515" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><a name="Page_502"></a>Bestirred to action, he summoned his counsellors, shared with them his fears and his hopes, and acquainted them with the nature of his plans. “Behold,” he
    exclaimed, “the storm which the Faith of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> has provoked in the hearts of my <mark class="term unknown">fellow-countrymen</mark>! Nothing short of his public execution can, to
    my mind, enable this distracted country to recover its tranquillity and peace. Who dare compute the forces that have perished in the course of the
    engagements at <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>? Who can estimate the efforts exerted to secure that victory? No sooner had the mischief that convulsed
    <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> been suppressed, than the flames of another sedition blazed forth in the province of <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark>, bringing in its wake so much suffering to my people.
    We had no sooner succeeded in quelling the revolt that had ravaged the south, than another insurrection breaks out in the north, sweeping in its vortex
    <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> and its surroundings. If you are able to advise a remedy, acquaint me with it, for my sole purpose is to ensure the peace and honour of my
    countrymen.”
<p></p><p>Not a single voice dared venture a reply, except that of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark> <mark class="term unknown"><u>Kh</u>ani-i-Núrí</mark>, the Minister of War, who pleaded <a name="Page_503"></a>Illustrations: THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>’S PRAYER BEADS AND SIGNET RING; <mark class="term misspelled">QURÁN</mark> <mark class="term correction">QUR’ÁN</mark> BELONGING TO THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>] <a name="Page_504"></a>that to put to death a banished siyyid for the
    deeds committed by a band of irresponsible agitators would be an act of manifest cruelty. He recalled the example of the late <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, whose
    invariable practice it had been to disregard the base calumnies the enemies of that siyyid brought continually to his attention. The <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark> <mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark> was sorely
    displeased. “Such considerations,” he protested, “are wholly irrelevant to the issue with which we are faced. The interests of the State are in jeopardy,
    and we can in no wise tolerate these periodic upheavals. Was not the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, in view of the paramount necessity for safeguarding the unity of the
    State, executed by those same persons who had seen him more than once receive marks of exceptional affection from <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, his Grandfather? Did they not
    in such circumstances refuse to consider the rights which his lineage had conferred upon him? Nothing short of the remedy I advocate can uproot this evil
    and bring us the peace for which we long.”
</p><p>Disregarding the advice of his counsellor, the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark> <mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark> despatched his orders to <mark class="term correct">Navváb</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥamzih</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, the governor of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark> <mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>, who was
distinguished among the princes of royal blood for his <mark class="term unknown">kind-heartedness</mark> and rectitude of conduct, to summon the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn516" name="_ftnref516" title="">[§§§§§§§§§]</a> He was careful not to divulge to the prince his real purpose. The <mark class="term correct">Navváb</mark>, assuming that the
    intention of the minister was to enable his Captive to return to His home, immediately directed one of his trusted officers, together with a mounted
    escort, to proceed to <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, where the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> still lay confined, and to bring Him back to <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>. He recommended Him to their care, urging them to
    exercise towards Him the utmost consideration.
</p>Forty days before the arrival of that officer at <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> collected all the documents and Tablets in His possession and, placing them, with
    His <mark class="term unknown">pen-case</mark>, His seals, and agate rings, in a coffer, entrusted them to the care of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Báqir</mark>, one of the Letters of the Living. To him He also
    delivered a letter addressed to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, His amanuensis, <a name="Page_505"></a>in which He enclosed the key to that coffer. He urged him to take the
    utmost care of that trust, emphasised the sacredness of its character, and bade him conceal its contents from anyone except <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Báqir</mark> departed forthwith for <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>. Within eighteen days he reached that town and was informed that <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> had departed for <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>. He left
immediately for that destination and arrived towards the middle of the month of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>a’bán</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>a‘bán</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn517" name="_ftnref517" title="">[**********]</a> I was then in <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, together with a certain <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq-i-Tabrízí</mark>, whom <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> had sent to
fetch me from <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark>. I was living in the same house with <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, a house which he had hired in the <mark class="term misspelled">Ba<u>gh</u>-Panbih</mark><mark class="term correction">Bá<u>gh</u>-Panbih</mark> quarter. In those days    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl</mark>, and a number of other companions likewise were dwelling with us. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Báqir</mark> delivered the trust into the hands
    of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, who, at the insistence of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark>, opened it before us. We marvelled when we beheld, among the things which that coffer
    contained, a scroll of blue paper, of the most delicate texture, on which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, in His own exquisite handwriting, which was a fine <mark class="term correct"><u>sh</u>ikastih</mark>
script, had penned, in the form of a pentacle, what numbered about five hundred verses, all consisting of derivatives from the word “<mark class="term correct">Bahá</mark>.”    <a href="#_ftn518" name="_ftnref518" title="">[††††††††††]</a> That scroll was in a state of perfect preservation, was spotlessly clean, and gave the
    impression, at first sight, of being a printed rather than a written page. So fine and intricate was the penmanship that, viewed at a distance, the writing
    appeared as a single wash of ink on the paper. We were overcome with admiration as we gazed upon a masterpiece which no calligraphist, we believed, could
    rival. That scroll was replaced in the coffer and handed back to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, who, on the very day he received it, proceeded to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. Ere he departed, he
informed us that all he could divulge of that letter was the injunction that the trust was to be delivered into the hands of <mark class="term correct">Jináb-i-Bahá</mark><a href="#_ftn519" name="_ftnref519" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>.<a href="#_ftn520" name="_ftnref520" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§]</a><a name="Page_506"></a>As to me, I was instructed by <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> to proceed to <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark> and join my father, who anxiously awaited my return.
<p></p>Faithful to the instructions he had received from <mark class="term correct">Navváb</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥamzih</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, that officer conducted the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> and showed Him the utmost respect and
    consideration. The prince had instructed one of his friends to accommodate Him in his home and to treat Him with extreme deference. Three days after the
<mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s arrival, a fresh order was received from the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, commanding the prince to carry out the execution of his Prisoner on the very day the <mark class="term correct">farmán</mark><a href="#_ftn521" name="_ftnref521" title="">[***********]</a> would reach him. Whoever would profess himself His follower was likewise to be condemned to
    death. The Armenian regiment of <mark class="term correct">Urúmíyyih</mark>, whose colonel was <mark class="term correct">Sám</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, was ordered to shoot Him, in the courtyard of the barracks of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, which
    were situated in the centre of the city.
<p></p>The prince expressed his consternation to the bearer of the <mark class="term correct">farmán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Vazír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Vazír-Niẓám</mark> and brother of the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>. “The <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark>,” he
    told him, “would do better to entrust me with services of greater merit than the one with which he has now commissioned me. The task I am called upon to
perform is a task that only ignoble people would accept. I am neither <mark class="term unknown">Ibn-i-Zíyad</mark> nor <mark class="term unknown">Ibn-i-Sa’d</mark><a href="#_ftn522" name="_ftnref522" title="">[†††††††††††]</a> that he should call upon me to slay an innocent descendant of the Prophet of God.” <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> reported these sayings of the prince to his brother, who thereupon ordered him to follow, himself, without delay and in their entirety,
    the instructions he had already given. “Relieve us,” the <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> urged his brother, “from this anxiety that weighs upon our hearts, and let this affair be
    brought to an end ere the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Ramadán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ramaḍán</mark> breaks upon us, that we may enter the period of fasting with undisturbed tranquillity.” <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>
    attempted to acquaint the prince with these fresh instructions, but failed in his efforts, as the prince, pretending to be ill, refused to meet him.
Undeterred by this refusal, he issued his instructions for the immediate transfer of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and those in His company from the house    <a name="Page_507"></a>in which He was staying to one of the rooms of the barracks. He, moreover, directed <mark class="term correct">Sám</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> to despatch ten of his men to
    guard the entrance of the room in which He was to be confined.
<p></p>Deprived of His turban and sash, the twin emblems of His noble lineage, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, together with <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, His amanuensis, was driven to yet another
    confinement which He well knew was but a step further on the way leading Him to the goal He had set Himself to attain. That day witnessed a tremendous
    commotion in the city of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>. The great convulsion associated in the ideas of its inhabitants with the Day of Judgment seemed at last to have come upon
    them. Never had that city experienced a turmoil so fierce and so mysterious as the one which seized its inhabitants on the day the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was led to that
    place which was to be the scene of His martyrdom. As He approached the courtyard of the barracks, a youth suddenly leaped forward who, in his eagerness to
    overtake Him, had forced his way through the crowd, utterly ignoring the risks and perils which such an attempt might involve. His face was haggard, his
    feet were bare, and his hair dishevelled. Breathless with excitement and exhausted with fatigue, he flung himself at the feet of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and, seizing the
    hem of His garment, passionately implored Him: “Send me not from Thee, O Master. Wherever Thou goest, suffer me to follow Thee.” “<mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>,” answered
    the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, “arise, and rest assured that you will be with Me.<a href="#_ftn523" name="_ftnref523" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><mark class="term unknown">To-morrow</mark> you shall witness what
    God has decreed.” Two other companions, unable to contain themselves, rushed forward and assured Him of their unalterable loyalty. These, together with
    <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alíy-i-Zunúzí</mark>, were seized and placed in the same cell in which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> were confined.
<p></p>I have heard <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> bear witness to the following: “That night the face of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was aglow with joy, a joy such as had never shone from His
countenance. Indifferent to the storm that raged about Him, He conversed with us with gaiety and cheerfulness. The sorrows that had weighed    <a name="Page_508"></a>so heavily upon Him seemed to have completely vanished. Their weight appeared to have dissolved in the consciousness of approaching
    victory. <mark class="term unknown">‘To-morrow</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He said to us, <mark class="term unknown">‘will</mark> be the day of My martyrdom. Would that one of you might now arise and, with his own hands, end My life. I prefer
    to be slain by the hand of a friend rather than by that of the enemy.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Tears rained from our eyes as we heard Him express that wish. We shrank, however, at
    the thought of taking away with our own hands so precious a life. We refused, and remained silent. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark> suddenly sprang to his feet and
    announced himself ready to obey whatever the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> might desire. This same youth who has risen to comply with My wish,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> declared, as soon as we had
    intervened and forced him to abandon that thought, <mark class="term unknown">‘will</mark>, together with Me, suffer martyrdom. Him will I choose to share with Me its crown.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”
<p></p><p>Early in the morning, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> ordered his <mark class="term correct">farrá<u>sh</u>-bá<u>sh</u>í</mark><a href="#_ftn524" name="_ftnref524" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> to
conduct the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> into the presence of the leading <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> of the city and to obtain from them the authorisation required for His execution.    <a href="#_ftn525" name="_ftnref525" title="">[************]</a> As the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was leaving the barracks, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> asked Him what he should do. “Confess
    not your faith,” He advised him. “Thereby you will be enabled, when the hour comes, to convey to those who are destined to hear you, the things of which
    you alone are aware.” He was engaged in a confidential conversation with him when the <mark class="term correct">farrá<u>sh</u>-bá<u>sh</u>í</mark> suddenly <a name="Page_509"></a>interrupted and, holding <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> by the hand, drew him aside and severely rebuked him. “Not until I have said to him all those things that I wish to
    say,” the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> warned the <mark class="term correct">farrá<u>sh</u>-bá<u>sh</u>í</mark>, “can any earthly power silence Me. Though all the world be armed against Me, yet shall they be
    powerless to deter Me from fulfilling, to the last word, My intention.” The <mark class="term correct">farrá<u>sh</u>-bá<u>sh</u>í</mark> was amazed at such a bold assertion. He made,
    however, no reply, and bade <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> arise and follow him.
</p>When <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark> was ushered into the presence of the <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark>, he was repeatedly urged, in view of the position which his stepfather, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alíy-i-Zunúzí</mark>, occupied, to recant his faith. “Never,” he exclaimed, “will I renounce my Master. He is the essence of my faith, and the object of my
    truest adoration. In Him I have found my paradise, and in the observance of His law I recognise the ark of my salvation.” “Hold your peace!” thundered
    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-i-Mamaqání</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-i-Mámáqání</mark>, before whom that youth was brought. “Such words betray your madness; I can well excuse the words for which you are not
    responsible.” “I am not mad,” he retorted. “Such a charge should rather be brought against you who have sentenced to death a man no less holy than the
    promised <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark>. He is not a fool who <a name="Page_510"></a>has embraced His Faith and is longing to shed his blood in His path.
<p></p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was, in His turn, brought before <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Muḥammad-i-Mamaqání</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥammad-i-Mámáqání</mark>. No sooner had he recognised Him than he seized the <mark class="term unknown">death-warrant</mark> he himself had
    previously written and, handing it to his attendant, bade him deliver it to the <mark class="term correct">farrá<u>sh</u>-bá<u>sh</u>í</mark>. “No need,” he cried, “to bring the
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> into my presence. This <mark class="term unknown">death-warrant</mark> I penned the very day I met him at the gathering presided over by the <mark class="term correct">Valí-‘Ahd</mark>. He surely is the same
    man whom I saw on that occasion, and has not, in the meantime, surrendered any of his claims.”
<p></p><p>From thence the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was conducted to the house of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Báqir</mark>, the son of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, to whom he had recently succeeded. When they arrived, they found his
    attendant standing at the gate and holding in his hand the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s <mark class="term unknown">death-warrant</mark>. “No need to enter,” he told them. “My master is already satisfied that his
    father was right in pronouncing the sentence of death. He can do no better than follow his example.”
</p><p><mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Murtadá-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Murtaḍá-Qulí</mark>, following in the footsteps of the other two <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark>, had previously issued his own written testimony and refused to meet face to face
his dreaded opponent. No sooner had the <mark class="term correct">farrá<u>sh</u>-bá<u>sh</u>í</mark> secured the necessary documents than he delivered his Captive into the hands of <mark class="term correct">Sám</mark>    <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, assuring him that he could proceed with his task now that he had obtained the sanction of the civil and ecclesiastical authorities of the
    realm.
</p><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had remained confined in the same room in which he had spent the previous night with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. They were proceeding to place <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark> in that same room, when he burst forth into tears and entreated them to allow him to remain with his Master. He was delivered into the hands
    of <mark class="term correct">Sám</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who was ordered to execute him also, if he persisted in his refusal to deny his Faith.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Sám</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was, in the meantime, finding himself increasingly affected by the behaviour of his Captive and the treatment that had been meted out to
    Him. He was seized with great fear lest his action should bring upon him the <a name="Page_511"></a>Illustration: THE <mark class="term unknown">BARRACK-SQUARE</mark> IN <mark class="term misspelled">TABRIZ</mark><mark class="term correction">TABRÍZ</mark>, WHERE THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark> SUFFERED MARTYRDOM. PILLAR ON THE RIGHT MARKED X IS THE PLACE WHERE HE WAS SUSPENDED AND SHOT]    <a name="Page_512"></a>wrath of God. “I profess the Christian Faith,” he explained to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, “and entertain no ill will against you. If your Cause be the
    Cause of Truth, enable me to free myself from the obligation to shed your blood.” “Follow your instructions,” the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> replied, “and if your intention be
    sincere, the Almighty is surely able to relieve you from your perplexity.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term correct">Sám</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> ordered his men to drive a nail into the pillar that lay between the door of the room that <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> occupied and the entrance to the
adjoining one, and to make fast two ropes to that nail, from which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and His companion were to be separately suspended.    <a href="#_ftn526" name="_ftnref526" title="">[††††††††††††]</a> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark> begged <mark class="term correct">Sám</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> to be placed in such a manner that his own body
    would shield that of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>.<a href="#_ftn527" name="_ftnref527" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> He was eventually suspended in such a position that his head
    reposed on the breast of his Master. As soon as they were fastened, a regiment of soldiers ranged itself in three files, each of two hundred and fifty men,
each of which was ordered to open fire in its turn until the whole detachment had discharged the volleys of its bullets.    <a href="#_ftn528" name="_ftnref528" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> The smoke of the firing of the seven hundred and fifty rifles was such as to turn the
    light of the noonday sun into darkness. There had crowded onto <a name="Page_513"></a>the roof of the barracks, as well as the tops of the adjoining
    houses, about ten thousand people, all of whom were witnesses to that sad and moving scene.
</p>As soon as the cloud of smoke had cleared away, an astounded multitude were looking upon a scene which their eyes could scarcely believe. There, standing
    before them alive and unhurt, was the companion of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, whilst He Himself had vanished uninjured from their sight. Though the cords with which they
were suspended had been rent in pieces by the bullets, yet their bodies had miraculously escaped the volleys.    <a href="#_ftn529" name="_ftnref529" title="">[*************]</a> Even the tunic which <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark> was wearing had, despite the thickness of the
    smoke, remained unsullied. “The <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> has gone from our sight!” rang out the voices of the bewildered multitude. They set out in a frenzied search
    for Him, and found Him, eventually, seated in the same room which He had occupied the night before, engaged in completing His interrupted conversation,
    with <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>. An expression of unruffled calm was upon His face. His body had emerged unscathed from the shower of bullets which the regiment had
    directed against Him. “I have finished My conversation with <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>,” the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> told the <mark class="term correct">farrá<u>sh</u>-bá<u>sh</u>í</mark>. “Now you may proceed to fulfil
    your intention.” The man was too much shaken to resume what he had already attempted. Refusing to accomplish his duty, he, that same moment, left that
    scene and resigned his post. He related all that he had seen to <a name="Page_514"></a>his neighbour, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥsin</mark>, one of the notables of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>,
    who, as soon as he heard the story, was converted to the Faith.
<p></p>I was privileged to meet, subsequently, this same <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥsin</mark>, who conducted me to the scene of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s martyrdom and showed me the wall where He
    had been suspended. I was taken to the room in which He had been found conversing with <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and was shown the very spot where He had been seated.
    I saw the very nail which His enemies had hammered into the wall and to which the rope which had supported His body had been attached.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Sám</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was likewise stunned by the force of this tremendous revelation. He ordered his men to leave the barracks immediately, and refused ever
    again to associate himself and his regiment with any act that involved the least injury to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. He swore, as he left that courtyard, never again to
    resume that task even though his refusal should entail the loss of his own life.
<p></p>No sooner had <mark class="term correct">Sám</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> departed than <mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ján</mark><mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>án-i-<u>Kh</u>amsíh</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>án-i-<u>Kh</u>amsih</mark>, colonel of the <mark class="term unknown">body-guard</mark>, known also by the names of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>amsíh</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>amsih</mark> and
    <mark class="term correct">Náṣirí</mark>, volunteered to carry out the order for execution. On the same wall and in the same manner, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and His companion were again suspended, while
    the regiment formed in line to open fire upon them. Contrariwise to the previous occasion, when only the cord with which they were suspended had been shot
into pieces, this time their bodies were shattered and were blended into one mass of mingled flesh and bone.    <a href="#_ftn530" name="_ftnref530" title="">[†††††††††††††]</a> “Had you believed in Me, O wayward generation,” were the last words of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to the
    gazing multitude as the regiment was preparing to fire the final volley, “every one of you would have followed the example of this youth, who stood in rank
    above most of you, and willingly would have sacrificed himself in My path. The day will come when you will have recognised Me; that day I shall have ceased
    to be with you.”<a href="#_ftn531" name="_ftnref531" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><a name="Page_515"></a>The very moment the shots were fired, a gale of exceptional severity arose and swept over the whole city. A whirlwind of dust of incredible density
    obscured the light of the sun and blinded the eyes of the people. The entire city remained enveloped in that darkness from noon till night. Even so strange
a phenomenon, following immediately in the wake of that still more astounding failure of <mark class="term correct">Sám</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>’s regiment to injure the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, was unable to move    <a name="Page_516"></a>the hearts of the people of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, and to induce them to pause and reflect upon the significance of such momentous events. They
    witnessed the effect which so marvellous an occurrence had produced upon <mark class="term correct">Sám</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>; they beheld the consternation of the <mark class="term correct">farrá<u>sh</u>-bá<u>sh</u>í</mark>
    and saw him make his irrevocable decision; they could even examine that tunic which, despite the discharge of so many bullets, had remained whole and
    stainless; they could read in the face of <a name="Page_517"></a>the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, who had emerged unhurt from that storm, the expression of undisturbed serenity as
    He resumed His conversation with <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>; and yet none of them troubled himself to enquire as to the significance of these unwonted signs and
    wonders.
<p></p>The martyrdom of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> took place at noon on Sunday, the <mark class="term unknown">twenty-eighth</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>a’bán</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>a‘bán</mark>, in the year 1266 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn532" name="_ftnref532" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><mark class="term unknown">thirty-one</mark> lunar years, seven months, and <mark class="term unknown">twenty-seven</mark> days from the day of His birth in    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>.
<p></p>On the evening of that same day, the mangled bodies of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and His companion were removed from the courtyard <a name="Page_518"></a>of the barracks to
    the edge of the moat outside the gate of the city. Four companies, each consisting of ten sentinels, were ordered to keep watch in turn over them. On the
    morning following the day of martyrdom, the Russian consul in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, accompanied by an artist, went to that spot and ordered that a sketch be made of the
    remains as they lay beside the moat.<a href="#_ftn533" name="_ftnref533" title="">[**************]</a>I have heard <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí-‘Askar</mark> relate the following: “An official of the Russian consulate, to whom I was related, showed me that same sketch on the very
    day it was drawn. It was such a faithful portrait of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> that I looked upon! No bullet had struck His forehead, His cheeks, or His lips. I gazed upon a
    smile which seemed to be still lingering upon His countenance. His body, however, had been severely mutilated. I could recognise the arms and head of His
    companion, who seemed to be holding Him in his embrace. As I gazed <mark class="term unknown">horror-struck</mark> upon that haunting picture, and saw how those noble traits had been
    disfigured, my heart sank within me. I turned away my face in anguish and, regaining my house, locked myself with my room. For three days and three nights,
    I could neither sleep nor eat, so overwhelmed was I with emotion. That short and tumultuous life, with all its sorrows, its turmoils, its banishments, and
    eventually the <mark class="term unknown">awe-inspiring</mark> martyrdom with which it had been crowned, seemed again to be <mark class="term unknown">re-enacted</mark> before my eyes. I tossed upon my bed, writhing in
    agony and pain.”
<p></p><p>On the afternoon of the second day after the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s martyrdom, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, son of <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, arrived at <mark class="term misspelled">Ba<u>gh</u>-Mí<u>sh</u>ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Bá<u>gh</u>-Mi<u>sh</u>ih</mark>, a
    suburb of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, and was received at the house of the <mark class="term correct">Kalantar</mark>,<a href="#_ftn534" name="_ftnref534" title="">[††††††††††††††]</a> one of his friends and
    confidants, <a name="Page_519"></a>who was a dervish and belonged to the <mark class="term unknown">súfí</mark> community. As soon as he had been informed of the imminent danger that
    threatened the life of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> had left <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> with the object of achieving His deliverance. To his dismay, he arrived too late
    to carry out his intention. No sooner had his host informed him of the circumstances that had led to the arrest and condemnation of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and related to
    him the events of His martyrdom, than he instantly resolved to carry away the bodies of the victims, even at the risk of endangering his own life. The
    <mark class="term correct">Kalantar</mark> advised him to wait and follow his suggestion rather than expose himself to what seemed to him would be inevitable death. He urged him to transfer
    his residence to another house and to wait for the arrival, that evening, of a certain <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Alláh-Yár</mark>, who, he said, would be willing to carry out whatever
    he might wish him to do. At the appointed hour, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> met <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Alláh-Yár</mark>, who succeeded, in the middle of that same night, in bearing
    the bodies from the edge of the moat to the silk factory owned by one of the believers of <mark class="term misspelled">Milán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mílán</mark>; laid them, the next day, in a specially constructed wooden
    case, and transferred them, according to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>’s directions, to a place of safety. Meanwhile the sentinels sought to justify themselves
    by pretending that, while they slept, wild beasts had carried away the bodies.<a href="#_ftn535" name="_ftnref535" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> Their
superiors, on their part, unwilling to compromise their own honour, concealed the truth and did not divulge it to the authorities.    <a href="#_ftn536" name="_ftnref536" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a>
</p><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> immediately reported the matter <a name="Page_520"></a>to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, who was then in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and who instructed <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark> to
    despatch a special messenger to <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> for the purpose of transferring the bodies to the capital. This decision was prompted by the wish the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> Himself
    had expressed <a name="Page_521"></a>in the “<mark class="term unknown">Zíyárat-i-<u>Sh</u>áh-’Abdu’l-’Azim</mark>,” a Tablet He had revealed while in the neighbourhood of that shrine and
    which He delivered to a certain <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Sulaymán-i-<u>Kh</u>atib</mark><mark class="term correction">Sulaymán-i-<u>Kh</u>aṭíb</mark>, who was instructed by Him to proceed together with a number of believers to that spot and
    to chant it within its precincts.<a href="#_ftn537" name="_ftnref537" title="">[***************]</a> “Well is it with you,” the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> addressed the buried
    saint in words such as these, in the concluding passages of that Tablet, “to have found your resting place in <mark class="term correct">Rayy</mark>, under the shadow of My Beloved. Would
    that I might be entombed within the precincts of that holy ground!”
<p></p><p>I was myself in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, in the company of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, when the bodies of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and His companion arrived. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had in the meantime departed for
<mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, in pursuance of the instructions of the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark> <mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark>, together with <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, transferred those remains from the <mark class="term correct">Imám-Zádih-Ḥasan</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn538" name="_ftnref538" title="">[†††††††††††††††]</a> where they were first taken, to a place the site of which remained unknown to anyone
    excepting themselves. That place remained secret until the departure of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> for Adrianople, at which time <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark> was charged to inform Munir,
    one of his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>, of the actual site where the bodies had been laid. In spite of his search, he was unable to find it. It was subsequently
    discovered by <mark class="term correct">Jamál</mark>, an old adherent of the Faith, to whom that secret was confided while <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> <a name="Page_522"></a>was still in Adrianople. That
    spot is, until now, unknown to the believers, nor can anyone conjecture where the remains will eventually be transferred.
</p>The first in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> to hear of the circumstances attending that cruel martyrdom, after the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, was <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Núrí</mark>, who had been
    banished to <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark> by <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> when the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was passing through that city. He had assured <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Jání</mark>, who had acquainted him with
    the precepts of the Faith, that if the love he bore for the new Revelation would cause him to regain his lost position, he would exert his utmost endeavour
    to secure the <mark class="term unknown">well-being</mark> and safety of the persecuted community. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Jání</mark> reported the matter to his Master, who charged him to assure the disgraced
    minister that ere long he would be summoned to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and would be invested, by his sovereign, with a position that would be second to none except that of
    the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> himself. He was warned not to forget his promise, and to strive to carry out his intention. He was delighted with that message, and renewed
    the assurance he had given.
<p></p>When the news of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s martyrdom reached him, he had already been promoted, had received the title of <mark class="term misspelled">I’timádu’d-Dawlih</mark><mark class="term correction">I‘timádu’d-Dawlih</mark>, and was hoping to be raised to
    the position of Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>. He hastened to inform <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, with whom he was intimately acquainted, of the news he had received, expressing the hope
    that the fire he feared would one day bring untold calamity upon Him, was at last extinguished. “Not so,” <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> replied. “If this be true, you can be
    certain that the flame that has been kindled will, by this very act, blaze forth more fiercely than ever, and will set up a conflagration such as the
    combined forces of the statesmen of this realm will be powerless to quench.” The significance of these words <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was destined to
    appreciate at a later time. Scarcely did he imagine, when that prediction was uttered, that the Faith which had received so staggering a blow could survive
    its Author. He himself had, on one occasion, been cured by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> of an illness from which he had given up all hope of recovery.
<p></p>His son, the <mark class="term correct">Nizámu’l-Mulk</mark>, one day asked him whether he did not think that <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, who, of all the sons of the late <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, had shown Himself the most
    capable, had failed <a name="Page_523"></a>to live up to the tradition of His father and had disappointed the hopes that had been reposed in Him. “My son,”
    he replied, “do you really believe him to be an unworthy son of his father? All that either of us can hope to achieve is but a fleeting and precarious
    allegiance which will vanish as soon as our days are ended. Our mortal life can never be free from the vicissitudes that beset the path of earthly
    ambition. Should we even succeed in ensuring, in our lifetime, the honour of our name, who can tell whether, after our death, calumny may not stain our
    memory and undo the work we have achieved? Even those who, while we are still living, honour us with their lips would, in their hearts, condemn and vilify
    us were we, for but one moment, to fail to promote their interests. Not so, however, with <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. Unlike the great ones of the earth, whatever be
    their race or rank, he is the object of a love and devotion such as time cannot dim nor enemy destroy. His sovereignty the shadows of death can never
    obscure nor the tongue of the slanderer undermine. Such is the sway of his influence that no among his loves dare, in the stillness of night, evoke the
    memory of the faintest desire that could, even remotely, be construed as contrary to his wish. Such lovers will greatly increase in number. The love they
    bear him will never grow less, and will be transmitted from generation to generation until the world shall have been suffused with its glory.”
<p></p><p>The malicious persistence with which a savage enemy sought to <mark class="term unknown">ill-treat</mark> and eventually to destroy the life of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> brought in its wake untold calamities
    upon Persia and its inhabitants. The men who perpetrated these atrocities fell victims to gnawing remorse, and in an incredibly short period were made to
    suffer ignominious deaths. As to the great mass of its people, who watched with sullen indifference the tragedy that was being enacted before their eyes,
    and who failed to raise a finger in protest against the hideousness of those cruelties, they fell, in their turn, victims to a misery which all the
    resources of the land and the energy of its statesmen were powerless to alleviate. The wind of adversity blew fiercely upon them, and shook to its
foundations their material prosperity. From the very day the hand of the assailant was stretched forth against the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and sought to    <a name="Page_524"></a>deal its fatal blow, to His Faith, visitation upon visitation crushed the spirit out of that ungrateful people, and brought them to
    the very brink of national bankruptcy. Plagues, the very names of which were almost unknown to them except for a cursory reference in the <mark class="term unknown">dust-covered</mark>
    books which few cared to read, fell upon them with a fury that none could escape. That scourge scattered devastation wherever it spread. Prince and peasant
    alike felt its sting and bowed to its yoke. It held the populace in its grip, and refused to relax its hold upon them. As malignant as the fever which
    decimated the province of <mark class="term correct">Gílán</mark>, these sudden afflictions continued to lay waste the land. Grievous as were these calamities, the avenging wrath of God did
    not stop at the misfortunes that befell a perverse and faithless people. It made itself felt in every living being that breathed on the surface of that
    stricken land. It affected the life of plants and animals alike, and made the people feel the magnitude of their distress. Famine added its horrors to the
    stupendous weight of afflictions under which the people were groaning. The gaunt spectre of starvation stalked abroad amidst them, and the prospect of a
    slow and painful death haunted their vision. People and government alike sighed for the relief which they could nowhere obtain. They drank the cup of woe
    to its dregs, utterly unregardful of the hand which had brought it to their lips, and of the Person for whose sake they were made to suffer.
</p>The first who arose to <mark class="term unknown">ill-treat</mark> the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was none other than <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the governor of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. His disgraceful treatment of his Captive
    cost him the lives of thousands who had been committed to his protection and who connived at his acts. His province was ravaged by a plague which brought
    it to the verge of destruction. Impoverished and exhausted, <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark> languished helpless beneath its weight, calling for the charity of its neighbours and the
    assistance of its friends. <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> himself witnessed with bitterness the undoing of all his labours, was condemned to lead in obscurity the
    remaining days of his life, and tottered to his grave, abandoned and forgotten, alike by his friends and his enemies.
<p></p>The next who sought to challenge the Faith of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark><a name="Page_525"></a>and to stem its progress was <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>. It was he who, for selfish
    purposes and in order to court the favour of the abject <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of his time, interposed between the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and endeavoured to prevent
    their meeting. It was he who pronounced the banishment of his dreaded Captive to a sequestered corner of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark> and, with dogged vigilance,
    kept watch over His isolation. It was he who was made the recipient of that denunciatory Tablet in which his Prisoner foreshadowed his doom and exposed his
    infamy. Barely a year and six months had passed after the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had reached the neighbourhood of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, when Divine vengeance hurled him from power and
    drove him to seek shelter within the inglorious precincts of the shrine of <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>áh-’Abdu’l-’Azim</mark>, a refugee from the wrath of his own people. From
    thence the hand of the Avenger drove him into exile beyond the confines of his native land, and plunged him into an ocean of afflictions until he met his
    death in circumstances of abject poverty and unspeakable distress.
<p></p>As to the regiment which, despite the unaccountable failure of <mark class="term correct">Sám</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> and his men to destroy the life of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, had volunteered to renew that
    attempt, and which eventually riddled His body with its bullets, two hundred and fifty of its members met their death in that same year, together with
    their officers, in a terrible earthquake. While they were resting on a hot summer day under the shadow of a wall on their way between <mark class="term correct">Ardibíl</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>,
    absorbed in their games and pleasures, the whole structure suddenly collapsed and fell upon them, leaving not one survivor. The remaining five hundred
    suffered the same fate as that which their own hands had inflicted upon the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. Three years after His martyrdom, that regiment mutinied, and its members
    were thereupon mercilessly shot by command of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Núrí</mark>. Not content with a first volley, he ordered that a second one be fired in
    order to ensure that none of the mutineers had survived. Their bodies were afterwards pierced with spears and lances, and left exposed to the gaze of the
    people of <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>. That day many of the inhabitants of the city, recalling the circumstances of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s martyrdom, wondered at that same fate which had
    overtaken those who had slain Him. “Could it be, by any chance, the vengeance <a name="Page_526"></a>of God,” a few were heard to whisper to one another,
    “that has brought the whole regiment to so dishonourable and tragic an end? If that youth had been a lying impostor, why should his persecutors have been
    so severely punished?” These expressed misgivings reached the ears of the leading <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> of the city, who were seized with great fear and ordered that
    all those who entertained such doubts should be severely punished. Some were beaten, others were fined, all were warned to cease such whisperings, which
    could only revive the memory of a terrible adversary and rekindle enthusiasm for His Cause.
<p></p>The prime mover of the forces that precipitated the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s martyrdom, the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, and also his brother, the <mark class="term misspelled">Vazír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Vazír-Niẓám</mark>, his chief accomplice, were,
    within two years of that savage act, subjected to a dreadful punishment, which ended miserably in their death. The blood of the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark> stains, to this
    very day, the wall of the bath of <mark class="term unknown">Fín</mark>,<a href="#_ftn539" name="_ftnref539" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> a witness to the atrocities his own hand had
    wrought.<a href="#_ftn540" name="_ftnref540" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><a name="Page_527"></a>CHAPTER XXIV: THE <mark class="term correct">ZANJÁN</mark> UPHEAVALTHE spark that had kindled the great conflagrations of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> had already set aflame <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark><a href="#_ftn541" name="_ftnref541" title="">[****************]</a> and its surroundings when the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> met His death in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>. Profound as was His sorrow
    at the sad and calamitous fate that had overtaken the heroes of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, the news of the no less tragic sufferings that had been the
    lot of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> and his companions, came as an added blow to His heart, already oppressed by the weight of manifold afflictions. The consciousness of the
    dangers that thickened around Him; the memory of the indignity He endured when He was last conducted to <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>; the strain of a prolonged and rigorous
    captivity amidst the mountain fastnesses of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>; the terrible butcheries that marked the closing stages of the <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>
    upheavals; the outrages to His Faith wrought by the persecutors of the Seven Martyrs of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>—even these were not all the troubles <a name="Page_528"></a>that beclouded the remaining days of a <mark class="term unknown">fast-ebbing</mark> life. He was already prostrated by the severity of these blows when the news of the happenings at
    <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, which were then beginning to foreshadow their sad events, reached Him and served to consummate the anguish of His last days. What pangs must He
    have endured as the shadows of death were fast gathering about Him! In every field, whether in the north or in the south, the champions of His Faith had
    been subjected to undeserved sufferings, had been infamously deceived, had been robbed of their possessions, and had been inhumanly massacred. And now, as
if to fill His cup of woes to <mark class="term unknown">over-flowing</mark>, <a name="Page_529"></a>there broke forth the storm of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, the most violent and devastating of them all.    <a href="#_ftn542" name="_ftnref542" title="">[††††††††††††††††]</a><p></p>I now proceed to relate the circumstances that have made of that event one of the most thrilling episodes in the history of this Revelation. Its chief
    figure was <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat-i-Zanjání</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat-i-Zanjání</mark>, whose name was <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>,<a href="#_ftn543" name="_ftnref543" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> one of the ablest
    ecclesiastical dignitaries of his age, and certainly one of the most formidable champions of the Cause. His father, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Raḥím-i-Zanjání</mark>, was one of the
    leading <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, and was greatly esteemed for his piety, his learning and force of character. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>, surnamed <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, was born in
    the year 1227 A.H.<a href="#_ftn544" name="_ftnref544" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> From his very boyhood, he showed such capacity that his father
lavished the utmost care upon his education. He sent him to <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark>, where he distinguished himself by his insight, his ability and fiery ardour.    <a href="#_ftn545" name="_ftnref545" title="">[*****************]</a> His scholarship and keen intelligence excited the admiration of his friends, whilst
his outspokenness and the strength of his character made him the terror of his adversaries. His father advised him not to return to <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>,<a name="Page_530"></a>where his enemies were conspiring against him. He accordingly decided to establish his residence in <mark class="term correct">Hamadán</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn546" name="_ftnref546" title="">[†††††††††††††††††]</a> where he married one of his kinswomen, and lived there for about two and a half
    years, when the news of his father’s death decided him to leave for his native town. The ovation accorded him on his arrival inflamed the hostility of the
<mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark>, who, despite their avowed opposition, received at his hands every mark of consideration and kindness.    <a href="#_ftn547" name="_ftnref547" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><p></p>From the pulpit of the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> which his friends erected in his honour, he urged the vast throng that gathered to hear him, to refrain from <mark class="term unknown">self-indulgence</mark>
    and to exercise moderation in all their acts.<a href="#_ftn548" name="_ftnref548" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> He ruthlessly suppressed every form of
    abuse, and by his example encouraged the people to adhere rigidly to the principles inculcated by the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>. Such were the care and ability with which he
    taught his disciples that they surpassed in knowledge and understanding the recognised <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>. For seventeen years, he pursued his meritorious
labours and succeeded in purging the minds and hearts of his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-townsmen</mark> from whatever seemed contrary to the spirit and teachings of their Faith.    <a href="#_ftn549" name="_ftnref549" title="">[******************]</a>When the Call from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> reached him, he despatched his trusted messenger, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Iskandar</mark>, to enquire into the claims of the new Revelation; and
    such was his response to <a name="Page_531"></a>that Message that his enemies were stirred to redouble their attacks upon him. Unable, hitherto, to
    disgrace him in the eyes of the government and the people, they now endeavoured to denounce him as an advocate of heresy and a repudiator of all that is
    sacred and cherished in <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. “His reputation for justice, for piety, wisdom, and learning,” they whispered to one another, “has been such as to render it
    impossible for us to shake his position. When summoned to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, in the presence of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> was he not able, by his magnetic eloquence, to
    win him over to his side, and make of him one of his devoted admirers? Now, however, that he has so openly championed the cause of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>, we can
    surely succeed in obtaining from the government the order for his arrest and banishment from our town.”
<p></p><p>They accordingly drew up a petition to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, in which they sought, by every device their malevolent and crafty minds could invent, to
    discredit his name. “While still professing himself a follower of our Faith,” they complained, “he, by the aid of his disciples, was able to repudiate our
    authority. Now that he has identified himself with the cause of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> and won over to that hateful creed <mark class="term unknown">two-thirds</mark> of the inhabitants of
    <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, what humiliation will he not inflict upon us! The concourse that throngs his gates, the whole <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> can no longer contain. Such is his influence
    that the <mark class="term correct">masjid</mark> that belonged to his father and the one that has been built in his honour, have been connected and made into one edifice in order to
    accommodate the <mark class="term unknown">ever-increasing</mark> multitude that hastens eagerly to follow his lead in prayer. The time is fast approaching when not only <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> but the
    neighbouring villages also will have declared themselves his supporters.”
</p><p>The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> was greatly surprised at the tone and language with which the petitioners sought to arraign <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>. He shared his astonishment with <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>
    <mark class="term unknown">Nazar-‘Alí</mark>, the <mark class="term unknown">Hakím-Bá<u>sh</u>í</mark>, and recalled the glowing tribute which many a visitor to <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> had paid to the abilities and integrity of the accused.
    He decided to summon him, together with his opponents, to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. In a special gathering at which he himself, together with <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark> and the
    leading officials of the government, as well as a number of the recognised <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> <a name="Page_532"></a>of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, had assembled, he called upon the
    ecclesiastical leaders of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> to vindicate the claims they had advanced. Whatever questions they submitted to <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, regarding the teachings of their
    Faith, he answered in a manner that could not fail to win the unqualified admiration of his hearers and to establish the sovereign’s confidence in his
    innocence. The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> expressed his entire satisfaction, and amply rewarded <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> for the excellent manner in which he had succeeded in refuting the
    allegations of his enemies. He bade him return to <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> and resume his valuable services to the cause of his people, assuring him that he would under all
circumstances support him and asking to be informed of any difficulty with which he might be faced in the future.    <a href="#_ftn550" name="_ftnref550" title="">[††††††††††††††††††]</a>
</p>His arrival at <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> was the signal for a fierce outburst on the part of his humiliated opponents. As the evidences of their hostility multiplied, the
marks of devotion on the part of his friends and supporters correspondingly increased.    <a href="#_ftn551" name="_ftnref551" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> Utterly disdainful of their machinations, he pursued his activities with unrelaxing
    zeal.<a href="#_ftn552" name="_ftnref552" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> The liberal principles which he unceasingly and fearlessly advocated struck at
    the very root of the fabric which a bigoted enemy had laboriously reared. They beheld with impotent fury the disruption of their authority and the collapse
    of their institutions.
<p></p>It was in those days that his special envoy, <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>hadí</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, whom he had confidentially despatched to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> with a petition and gifts from
    him to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, arrived at <a name="Page_533"></a><mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> and delivered into his hands, while he was addressing his disciples, a sealed letter from his
    Beloved. In the Tablet he received, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> conferred upon him one of His own titles, that of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, and urged him to proclaim from the pulpit, without
    the least reservation, the fundamental teachings of His Faith. No sooner was he informed of the wishes of his Master than he declared his resolve to devote
    himself to the immediate enforcement of whatever injunction that Tablet contained. He immediately dismissed his disciples, bade them close their books, and
    declared his intention of discontinuing his courses of study. “Of what profit,” he said, “are study and research to those who have already found the Truth,
    and why strive after learning when He who is the Object of all knowledge is made manifest?”
<p></p><p>As soon as he attempted to lead the congregation in offering the Friday prayer, enjoined upon him by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn553" name="_ftnref553" title="">[*******************]</a> the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>, who had hitherto performed that duty, vehemently protested, on the
    ground that this right was the exclusive privilege of his own forefathers, that it had been conferred upon him by his sovereign, and that no one, however
    exalted his station, could usurp it. “That right,” <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> retorted, “has been superseded by the authority with which the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> Himself has invested me. I
    have been commanded by Him to assume that function publicly, and I cannot allow any person to trespass upon that right. If attacked, I will take steps to
    defend myself and to protect the lives of my companions.”
</p><p>His fearless insistence on the duty laid upon him by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> caused the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> to league themselves with the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>    <a href="#_ftn554" name="_ftnref554" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††]</a> and to lay their complaints before <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, pleading that <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> had
    challenged the validity <a name="Page_534"></a>of recognised institutions and trampled upon their rights. “We must either flee from this town with our
    families and belongings,” they pleaded, “and leave him in sole charge of the destinies of its people, or obtain from <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> an edict for his
    immediate expulsion from this country; for we firmly believe that to allow him to remain on its soil would be courting disaster.” Though <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>,
    in his heart, distrusted the ecclesiastical order of his country and had a natural aversion to their beliefs and practices, he was forced eventually to
    yield to their pressing demands, and submitted the matter to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, who ordered the transfer of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> from <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> to the capital.
</p>A Kurd named Qilij <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was commissioned by the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> to deliver the royal summons to <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had meanwhile arrived in the
    neighbourhood of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> on His way to <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>. Ere the arrival of the royal messenger at <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> had sent one of his friends, a certain <u>Kh</u><mark class="term unknown">án-Muḥammad-i-Tub-<u>Ch</u>í</mark>, to his Master with a petition in which he begged to be allowed to rescue Him from the hands of the enemy. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> assured him
    that His deliverance the Almighty alone could achieve and that no one could escape from His decree or evade His law. “As to your meeting with Me,” He
    added, “it soon will take place in the world beyond, the home of unfading glory.”
<p></p><p>The day <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> received that message, Qilij <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> arrived at <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, acquainted him with the orders he had received, and set out, accompanied by him,
    for the capital. Their arrival at <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> coincided with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s departure from the village of <mark class="term correct">Kulayn</mark>, where He had been detained for some days.
</p>The authorities, apprehensive lest a meeting between the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> might lead to fresh disturbances, had taken the necessary precautions to ensure the
    absence of the latter from <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> during the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s passage through that town. The companions who were following <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> at a distance, whilst he was on his
    way to the capital, were urged by him to return and try to meet their Master and to assure Him of his readiness to come to His rescue. On their way back to
    their homes, they encountered the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, who again expressed His desire that no one of His friends should attempt to <a name="Page_535"></a>deliver Him from
    His captivity. He even directed them to tell the believers among their <mark class="term unknown">fellow-townsmen</mark> not to press round Him, but even to avoid Him wherever He went.
<p></p>No sooner had that message been delivered to those who had gone out to welcome Him on His approach to their town than they began to grieve and deplore
    their fate. They could not, however, resist the impulse that drove them to march forth to meet Him, forgetful of the desire He had expressed.
<p></p>As soon as they were met by the guards who were marching in advance of their Captive, they were ruthlessly dispersed. On reaching a fork in the road, there
    arose an altercation <a name="Page_536"></a>between <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Big-i-<u>Ch</u>apar<u>ch</u>í</mark><mark class="term correction">Big-i-<u>Ch</u>apár<u>ch</u>í</mark> and his colleague, who had been despatched from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> to assist
    in conducting the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> Big insisted that their Prisoner should be taken into the town, where He should be allowed to pass the night in
    the caravanserai of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Ma’ṣúm-i-Tabíb</mark>, the father of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Muḥammad-‘Alíy-i-Tabíb</mark>, a martyr of the Faith, before resuming their march to <mark class="term unknown">Á<u>dh</u></mark><mark class="term unknown">irbayján</mark>. He pleaded that to pass the night outside the gate would be to expose their lives to danger, and would encourage their opponents to attempt an
    attack upon them. He eventually succeeded in convincing his colleague that he should conduct the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> to that caravanserai. As they were passing through the
    streets, they were amazed to see the multitude that had crowded onto the housetops in their eagerness to catch a glimpse of the face of the Prisoner.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Ma’ṣúm</mark>, the former owner of the caravanserai, had lately died, and his eldest son, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark>, the leading physician of <mark class="term correct">Hamadán</mark>, who, though
    not a believer, was a true lover of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, had arrived at <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> and was in mourning for his father. He lovingly received the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> in the caravanserai he
    had specially prepared beforehand for His reception. That night he remained until a late hour in His presence and was completely won over to His Cause.
<p></p>“The same night that witnessed my conversion,” I heard him subsequently relate, “I arose ere break of day, lit my lantern, and, preceded by my father’s
    attendant, directed my steps towards the caravanserai. The guards who were stationed at the entrance recognised me and allowed me to enter. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was
    performing His ablutions when I was ushered into His presence. I was greatly impressed when I saw Him absorbed in His devotions. A feeling of reverent joy
    filled my heart as I stood behind Him and prayed. I myself prepared His tea and was offering it to Him when He turned to me and bade me depart for <mark class="term correct">Hamadán</mark>.
    <mark class="term unknown">‘This</mark> town,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He said, <mark class="term unknown">‘will</mark> be thrown into a great tumult, and its streets will run with blood.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I expressed my strong desire to be allowed to shed my
blood in His path. He assured me that the hour of my martyrdom had not yet come, and bade me be resigned to whatever God might decree. At the hour    <a name="Page_537"></a>of sunrise, as He mounted His horse and was preparing to depart, I begged to be allowed to follow Him, but He advised me to remain,
    and assured me of His unfailing prayers. Resigning myself to His will, with regret I watched Him disappear from my sight.”
<p></p><p>On his arrival at <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> was conducted into the presence of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>; who, on behalf of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and himself, expressed his
    annoyance at the intense hostility which his conduct had aroused among the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>. “<mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and I,” he told him, “are continually
    besieged by the oral as well as written denunciations brought against you. I could scarcely believe their indictment relating to your desertion of the
    Faith of your forefathers. Nor is the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> inclined to credit such assertions. I have been commanded by him to summon you to his capital and to call
    upon you to refute such accusations. It grieves me to hear that a man whom I consider infinitely superior in knowledge and ability to the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark> has
    chosen to identify himself with his creed.” “Not so,” replied <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>; “God knows that if that same <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> were to entrust me with the meanest service in
    His household, I would deem it an honour such as the highest favours of my sovereign could never hope to surpass.” “This can never be!” burst forth <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>. “It is my firm and unalterable conviction,” <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> reaffirmed, “that this <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> is the very One whose advent you yourself,
    with all the peoples of the world, are eagerly awaiting. He is our Lord, our promised Deliverer.
</p><mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark> reported the matter to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, to whom he expressed his fears that to allow so formidable an adversary, whom the sovereign
    himself believed to be the most accomplished of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of his realm, to pursue unhindered the course of his activities would be a policy fraught with
    gravest danger to the State. The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, disinclined to credit such reports, which he attributed to the malice and envy of the enemies of the accused,
    ordered that a special meeting be convened at which he should be asked to vindicate his position in the presence of the assembled <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of the capital.
<p></p>Several meetings were held for that purpose, before each <a name="Page_538"></a>of which <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> eloquently set forth the basic claims of his Faith and
    confounded the arguments of those who tried to oppose him. “Is not the following tradition,” he boldly declared, “recognised alike by <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark> and
    <mark class="term correct">sunní</mark><mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>: <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> leave amidst you my twin testimonies, the Book of God and my <mark class="term unknown">family’</mark>? Has not the second of these testimonies, in your opinion, passed
    away, and is not our sole means of guidance, as a result, contained in the testimony of the sacred Book? I appeal to you to measure every claim that either
    of us shall advance, by the standard established in that Book, and to regard it as the supreme authority whereby the righteousness of our argument can be
    judged.” Unable to defend their case against him, they, as a last resort, ventured to ask him to produce a miracle whereby to establish the truth of his
    assertion. “What greater miracle,” he exclaimed, “than that He should have enabled me to triumph, alone and unaided, by the simple power of my argument,
    over the combined forces of the <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> and <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>?”
<p></p><p>The masterly manner in which <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> refuted the unsound claims advanced by his adversaries won for him the favour of his sovereign, who from that day forth
    was no longer swayed by the insinuations of his enemies. Although the entire company of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, as well as a number of the ecclesiastical
    leaders of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, had declared him to be an infidel and condemned him to death, yet <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> continued to bestow his favours upon him and to
    assure him that he could rely on his support. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, though at heart unfriendly to <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, was unable, in the face of such unmistakable
    evidences of royal favour, to resist his influence openly, and by his frequent visits to his house, and by the gifts he lavished upon him, that deceitful
    minister sought to conceal his resentment and envy.
</p><mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> was virtually a prisoner in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. He was unable to go beyond the gates of the capital, nor was he allowed free intercourse with his friends. The
    believers among his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-townsmen</mark> eventually determined to send a deputation and ask him for fresh instructions regarding their attitude towards the laws
and principles of their Faith. He charged them to observe with absolute loyalty the admonitions he had received from the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> through the messengers he had    <a name="Page_539"></a>sent to investigate His Cause. He enumerated a series of observances, some of which constituted a definite departure from the
    established traditions of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. “<mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim-i-Zanjání</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim-i-Zanjání</mark>,” he assured them, “has been intimately connected with my Master both in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> and in
    <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>. He, as well as <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Iskandar</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>hadí</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, both of whom I sent to meet Him, have positively declared that He Himself is the first to
    practise the observances He has enjoined upon the faithful. It therefore behoves us who are His supporters to follow His noble example.”
<p></p><p>These explicit instructions were no sooner read to his companions than they became inflamed with an irresistible desire to carry out his wishes. They
    enthusiastically set to work to enforce the laws of the new Dispensation, and, giving up their former customs and practices, unhesitatingly identified
    themselves with its claims. Even the little children were encouraged to follow scrupulously the admonitions of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. “Our beloved Master,” they were

    lives?”
</p><p><mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> was still a captive in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> when the news of the siege of the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> reached him. He longed, and deplored his inability, to throw in his
    lot with those of his companions who were struggling with such splendid heroism for the emancipation of their Faith. His sole consolation in those days was
    his close association with <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, from whom he received the sustaining power that enabled him, in the time to come, to distinguish himself by deeds
    no less remarkable than those which that company had manifested in the darkest hours of their memorable struggle.
</p>He was still in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> when <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> passed away, leaving the throne to his son <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn555" name="_ftnref555" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> The <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, the new Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, decided to make <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>’s imprisonment more
    rigorous, and to seek in the meantime a way of destroying him. On being informed of the imminence of the danger that threatened his life, his captive
    decided to <a name="Page_540"></a>leave <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> in disguise and join his companions, who eagerly awaited his return.
<p></p>His arrival at his native town, which a certain <mark class="term correct">Karbilá’í</mark><mark class="term unknown">Valí-’Attar</mark> announced to his companions, was a signal for a tremendous demonstration of devoted
    loyalty on the part of his many admirers. They flocked out, men, women, and children, to welcome him and to renew their assurances of abiding and
undiminished affection.<a href="#_ftn556" name="_ftnref556" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> The governor of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, <mark class="term unknown">Majdu’d-Dawlih</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn557" name="_ftnref557" title="">[********************]</a> the maternal uncle of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, astounded by the spontaneity of
    that ovation, ordered, in the fury of his despair, that the tongue of <mark class="term correct">Karbilá’í</mark><mark class="term unknown">Valí-’Attar</mark> be immediately cut out. Though at heart he loathed <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, he
    pretended to be his friend and <mark class="term unknown">well-wisher</mark>. He often visited him and showed him unbounded consideration, yet he was secretly conspiring against his life
    and was waiting for the moment when he could strike the fatal blow.
<p></p>That smouldering hostility was soon to be fanned into flame by an incident that was of little importance in itself. The occasion was afforded when a
    quarrel suddenly broke out between two children of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, one of whom belonged to a kinsman of one of the companions of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>. The governor immediately
    ordered that child to be arrested and placed in strict confinement. A sum of money was offered <a name="Page_541"></a>by the believers to the governor, in
    order to induce him to release his young prisoner. He refused their offer, whereupon they complained to <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, who vehemently protested. “That child,” he
    wrote to the governor, “is too young to be held responsible for his behaviour. If he deserves punishment, his father and not he should be made to suffer.”
<p></p><p>Finding that the appeal had been ignored, he renewed his protest and entrusted it to the hands of one of his influential comrades, <mark class="term correct">Mír</mark> <mark class="term unknown">Jalíl</mark>, father of
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> A<u>sh</u>raf and martyr of the Faith, directing him to present it in person to the governor. The guards stationed at the entrance of the house at
    first refused him admittance. Indignant at their refusal, he threatened to force his way through the gate, and succeeded, by the mere threat of unsheathing
    his sword, in overcoming their resistance and in compelling the infuriated governor to release the child.
</p>The unconditional compliance of the governor with the demand of <mark class="term correct">Mír</mark><mark class="term unknown">Jalíl</mark> stirred the furious indignation of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark>. They violently protested, and
    deprecated his submission to the threats with which their opponents had sought to intimidate him. They expressed to him their fear that such a surrender on
    his part would encourage them to make still greater demands upon him, would enable them before long to assume the reins of authority and to exclude him
    from any share in the administration of the government. They eventually induced him to consent to the arrest of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, an act which they were convinced
    would succeed in checking the progress of his influence.
<p></p>The governor reluctantly consented. He was repeatedly assured by the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> that his action would under no circumstances endanger the peace and security
    of the town. Two of their supporters, <mark class="term unknown">Pahlaván</mark><a href="#_ftn558" name="_ftnref558" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††]</a><mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark> and <mark class="term unknown">Pahlaván</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Safar-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣafar-‘Alí</mark>,
    both notorious for their brutality and prodigious strength, volunteered to seize <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> and deliver him <mark class="term unknown">hand-cuffed</mark> to the governor. Each was promised a
    handsome reward in return for this service. Clad in their amour, with helmets on their heads, and followed by a band of ruffians recruited from among the
    most degraded of the population. <a name="Page_542"></a>they set out to accomplish their purpose. The <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> were in the meantime busily engaged in
    inciting the populace and encouraging them to reinforce their efforts.
<p></p>As soon as the emissaries arrived in the quarter in which <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> was living, they were unexpectedly confronted by <mark class="term correct">Mír</mark> Salah, one of his most formidable
    supporters, who, together with seven of his armed companions, strenuously opposed their advance. He asked <mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark> whither he was bound, and, on
receiving from him an insulting answer, unsheathed his sword and, with the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!”    <a href="#_ftn559" name="_ftnref559" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> sprang upon him and wounded him in the forehead. <mark class="term correct">Mír</mark> Salah’s audacity, in spite of
the heavy amour which his adversary was wearing, frightened the whole band and caused them to flee in different directions.    <a href="#_ftn560" name="_ftnref560" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><p></p>The cry which that <mark class="term unknown">stout-hearted</mark> defender of the Faith raised on that day was heard for the first time in <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, a cry that spread panic through the town.
    The governor was terrified by its tremendous force, and asked what that shout could mean and whose voice had been able to raise it. He was gravely shaken
    when told that it was the watchword of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>’s companions, with which they called for the assistance of the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> in the hour of distress.
<p></p>The remnants of that affrighted band encountered, shortly after, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term unknown">Muḥammad-i-Tub-<u>Ch</u>í</mark>, whom they immediately recognised as one of
    their ablest adversaries. Finding him unarmed, they fell upon him and, with an axe one of them was carrying, struck him and broke his head. They bore him
    to the governor, and no sooner had they laid down the wounded man than a certain <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark>, one of the <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> who was present, leaped
    forward and, with his penknife, stabbed him in the breast. The governor too, unsheathing his sword, struck him on the mouth and was followed by the
    attendants who, with the weapons they carried with them, completed the murder of their hapless victim. As their blows rained upon him, unmindful of his
    sufferings, he was heard to say: “I thank Thee, O my God, for having vouchsafed me the crown of martyrdom.” <a name="Page_543"></a>He was the first among
the believers of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> to lay down his life in the path of the Cause. His death, which occurred on Friday, the fourth of <mark class="term correct">Rajab</mark>, in the year 1266 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn561" name="_ftnref561" title="">[*********************]</a> preceded by <mark class="term unknown">forty-five</mark> days the martyrdom of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> and by <mark class="term unknown">fifty-five</mark> days that of
    the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>.
<p></p>The blood that was shed on that day, far from allaying the hostility of the enemy, served further to inflame their passions, and to reinforce their
    determination to subject to the same fate the rest of the companions. Encouraged by the governor’s tacit approval of their expressed intentions, they
    resolved to put to death all upon whom they could lay their hands, without obtaining beforehand an express authorisation from the government officials.
They solemnly covenanted among themselves not to rest until they had extinguished the fire of what they deemed a shameless heresy.    <a href="#_ftn562" name="_ftnref562" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††]</a> They compelled the governor to bid a crier proclaim throughout <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> that
    whoever was willing to endanger his life, to forfeit his property, and expose his wife and children to misery and shame, should throw in his lot with
    <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> and his companions; and that those desirous of ensuring the <mark class="term unknown">well-being</mark> and honour of themselves and their families, should withdraw from the
    neighbourhood in which those companions resided and seek the shelter of the sovereign’s protection.
<p></p>That warning immediately divided the inhabitants into two distinct camps, and severely tested the faith of those who were still wavering in their
    allegiance to the Cause. It gave rise to the most pathetic scenes, caused the separation of fathers from their sons and the estrangement of brothers and of
    kindred. Every tie of worldly affection seemed to be dissolving on that day, and the solemn pledges were forsaken in favour of a loyalty mightier and more
    sacred than any earthly allegiance. <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> fell a prey to the wildest excitement. The cry of distress which members of divided families, in a frenzy of
    despair, raised to heaven, mingled with the blasphemous shouts which a threatening enemy <a name="Page_544"></a>hurled upon them. Shouts of exultation
    hailed at every turn those who, tearing themselves from their homes and kinsmen, enrolled themselves as willing supporters of the Cause of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>. The camp
    of the enemy hummed with feverish activity in preparation for the great struggle upon which they had secretly determined. Reinforcements were rushed into
    the town from the neighbouring villages, at the command of its governor and with the encouragement of the <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark>, the siyyids, and the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> who
    supported him.<a href="#_ftn563" name="_ftnref563" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><p></p>Undeterred by the growing tumult, <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> ascended the pulpit and, with uplifted voice, proclaimed to the congregation: “The hand of Omnipotence has, in
    this day, separated truth from falsehood and divided the light of guidance from the darkness of error. I am unwilling that because of me you should suffer
    injury. The one aim of the governor and of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> who support him is to seize and kill me. They cherish no other ambition. They thirst for my blood
    and seek no one besides me. Whoever among you feels the least desire to safeguard his life against the perils with which we are beset, whoever is reluctant
to offer his life for our Cause, let him, ere it is too late, betake himself from this place and return whence he came.”    <a href="#_ftn564" name="_ftnref564" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><p></p>That day more than three thousand men were recruited by the governor from the surrounding villages of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>. Meanwhile <mark class="term correct">Mír</mark> Salah, accompanied by a number
    of his comrades, who observed the growing restiveness of their <a name="Page_545"></a>opponents, sought the presence of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> and urged him, as a
precautionary measure, to transfer his residence to the fort of <mark class="term unknown">‘Alí-Mardán</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn565" name="_ftnref565" title="">[**********************]</a> adjacent to the quarter in which he was residing. <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> gave his consent and
    ordered that their women and children, together with such provisions as they might require, be taken to the fort. Though they found it occupied by its
    owners, the companions eventually induced them to withdraw, and gave them in exchange the houses in which they themselves had been dwelling.
<p></p>The enemy was meanwhile preparing for a violent attack upon them. No sooner had a detachment of their forces opened fire upon the barricades the companions
    had raised than <mark class="term correct">Mír</mark><mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark>, a siyyid of exceptional courage, asked his leader to allow him to attempt to capture the governor and to bring him as a prisoner
    to the fort. <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, unwilling to comply with his request, advised him not to risk his life.
<p></p>The governor was so overcome with fear when informed of that siyyid’s intention that he decided to leave <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> immediately. He was, however, dissuaded
    from taking that course by a certain siyyid who pleaded that his departure would be the signal for grave disturbances such as would disgrace him in the
    sight of his superiors. The siyyid himself <a name="Page_546"></a>set out, as evidence of his earnestness, to launch an offensive against the occupants of
    the fort. He had no sooner given the signal for attack and advanced at the head of a band of thirty of his comrades, than he unexpectedly encountered two
    of his adversaries who were marching with drawn swords towards him. Believing that they intended to assail him, he, with the whole of his band, was
    suddenly seized with panic, straightway regained his home, and, forgetful of the assurances he had given to the governor, remained the whole day closeted
    within his room. Those who were with him promptly dispersed, renouncing the thought of pursuing the attack. They were subsequently informed that the two
    men they had encountered had no hostile intention against them, but were simply on their way to fulfil a commission with which they had been entrusted.
<p></p>That humiliating episode was soon followed by a number of similar attempts on the part of the supporters of the governor, all of which utterly failed to
    achieve their purpose. Every time they rushed to attack the fort, <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> would order a few of his companions, who were three thousand in number, to emerge
    from their retreat and scatter their forces. He never failed, every time he gave them such orders, to caution his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> against shedding
    unnecessarily the blood of their assailants. He constantly reminded them that their action was of a purely defensive character, and that their sole purpose
    was to preserve inviolate the security of their women and children. “We are commanded,” he was frequently heard to observe, “not to wage holy war under any
    circumstances against the unbelievers, whatever be their attitude towards us.”
<p></p><p>This state of affairs continued<a href="#_ftn566" name="_ftnref566" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> until the orders of the <a name="Page_547"></a><mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark> <mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark> reached one of the generals of the imperial army, <mark class="term unknown">Sadru’d-Dawliy-i-Iṣfáhání</mark> by name,    <a href="#_ftn567" name="_ftnref567" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> who had set out at the head of two regiments for <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark> <mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>. The written
    orders of the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> reached him in <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>amsíh</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>amsih</mark>, bidding him cancel his projected journey and proceed immediately to <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> and there give his
    assistance to the forces that had been mustered by the government. “You have been commissioned by your sovereign,” the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark> <mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark> wrote him, “to subjugate
    the band of <mark class="term unknown">mischief-makers</mark> in and around <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>. It is your privilege to crush their hopes and exterminate their forces. So signal a service, at so
    critical a moment, will win for you the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s highest favour, no less than the applause and esteem of his people.”
</p><p>This encouraging <mark class="term correct">farmán</mark> stirred the imagination of the ambitious <mark class="term unknown">Sadru’d-Dawlih</mark>. He marched instantly on <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> at the head of his two regiments, organised
the forces which the governor placed at his disposal, and gave orders for a combined attack upon the fort and its defenders.    <a href="#_ftn568" name="_ftnref568" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> The <a name="Page_548"></a>contest raged in the environs of the fort three days
    and three nights, in the course of which the besieged, under the direction of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, resisted with splendid daring the fierce onslaught of their
    assailants. Neither their overwhelming numbers nor the superiority of their equipment and training could enable them to reduce the intrepid companions to
    an unconditional surrender.<a href="#_ftn569" name="_ftnref569" title="">[***********************]</a> Undeterred by the fire of the cannon with which they
    were deluged, and forgetful of both sleep and hunger, they rushed in a headlong charge out of the fort, utterly unmindful of the perils incurred by such a
    sally. To the imprecations with which an opposing host greeted their appearance from their retreat, they shouted their answer of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!” and,
    carried away by the spell which that invocation threw upon them, hurled themselves upon the enemy and scattered his forces. The frequency and success of
    these sallies demoralised their assailants and convinced them of the futility of their efforts. They were soon compelled to acknowledge their powerlessness
    to win a decisive victory. <mark class="term unknown">Sadru’d-Dawlih</mark> himself had to confess that after the lapse of nine months of sustained fighting, all the men who had originally
    belonged to his two regiments, no more than thirty crippled soldiers were left to support him. Filled with humiliation, he was forced, eventually, to admit
    his powerlessness to daunt the spirit of his opponents. He was degraded from his rank and gravely reprimanded by his sovereign. The hopes he had fondly
    cherished were, as the result of that defeat, irretrievably shattered. <a name="Page_549"></a>So abject a defeat struck dismay into the hearts of the people of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>. Few were willing, after that disaster, to risk their lives in hopeless
    encounters. Only those who were compelled to fight ventured to renew their attacks upon the besieged. The brunt of the struggle was mainly borne by the
    regiments which were being successively despatched from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> for that purpose. While the inhabitants of the town, and particularly the merchant class
    among them, profited greatly by the sudden influx of such a large number of forces, the companions of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> suffered want and privation within the walls
    of the fort. Their supplies dwindled rapidly; their only hope of receiving any food from outside lay in the efforts, often unsuccessful, of a few women who
    could manage, under various pretexts, to approach the fort and sell them at an exorbitant price the provisions they so sadly needed.
</p>Though oppressed with hunger and harassed by fierce and sudden onsets, they maintained with unflinching determination the defence of the fort. Sustained by
    a hope that no amount of adversity could dim, they succeeded in erecting no less than <mark class="term unknown">twenty-eight</mark> barricades, each of which was entrusted to the care of a
    group of nineteen of their <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>. At each barricade, nineteen additional companions were stationed as sentinels, whose function it was to watch
    and report the movements of the enemy.
<p></p>They were frequently surprised by the voice of the crier whom the enemy sent to the neighbourhood of the fort to induce its occupants to desert <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> and
    his Cause. “The governor of the province,” he would proclaim, “and the <mark class="term unknown">commander-in-chief</mark> too, are willing to forgive and extend a safe passage to whoever
    among you will decide to leave the fort and renounce his faith. Such a man will be amply rewarded by his sovereign, who, in addition to lavishing gifts
    upon him, will invest him with the dignity of noble rank. Both the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and his representatives have pledged their honour not to depart from the
    promise they have given.” To this call the besieged would, with one voice, return contemptuous and decisive replies.
<p></p>Further evidence of the spirit of sublime renunciation animating those valiant companions was afforded by the behaviour of a village maiden, who, of her
    own accord, threw <a name="Page_550"></a>in her lot with the band of women and children who had joined the defenders of the fort. Her name was Zaynab, her
    home a tiny hamlet in the near neighbourhood of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>. She was comely and fair of face, was fired with a lofty faith, and endowed with intrepid courage.
    The sight of the trials and hardships which her men companions were made to endure stirred in her an irrepressible yearning to disguise herself in male
    attire and share in repulsing the repeated attacks of the enemy. Donning a tunic and wearing a <mark class="term unknown">head-dress</mark> like those of her men companions, she cut off her
    locks, girt on a sword, and, seizing a musket and a shield, introduced herself into their ranks. No one suspected her of being a maid when she leaped
    forward to take her place behind the barricade. As soon as the enemy charged, she bared her sword and, raising the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!” flung
    herself with incredible audacity upon the forces arrayed against her. Friend and foe marvelled that day at a courage and resourcefulness the equal of which
    their eyes had scarcely ever beheld. Her enemies pronounced her the curse which an angry Providence had hurled upon them. Overwhelmed with despair and
    abandoning their barricades, they fled in disgraceful rout before her.
<p></p><mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, who was watching the movements of the enemy from one of the turrets, recognised her and marvelled at the prowess which that maiden was displaying.
    She had set out in pursuit of her assailants, when he ordered his men to bid her return to the fort and give up the attempt. “No man,” he was heard to say,
    as he saw her plunge into the fire directed upon her by the enemy, “has shown himself capable of such vitality and courage.” When questioned by him as to
    the motive of her behaviour, she burst into tears and said: “My heart ached with pity and sorrow when I beheld the toil and sufferings of my
    <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>. I advanced by an inner urge I could not resist. I was afraid lest you would deny me the privilege of throwing in my lot with my men
    companions.” “You are surely the same Zaynab,” <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> asked her, “who volunteered to join the occupants of the fort?” “I am,” she replied. “I can
confidently assure you that no one has hitherto discovered my sex. You alone have recognised me. I adjure you by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> not to withhold    <a name="Page_551"></a>from me that inestimable privilege, the crown of martyrdom, the one desire of my life.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> was profoundly impressed by the tone and manner of her appeal. He sought to calm the tumult of her soul, assured her of his prayers in her behalf,
    and gave her the name <mark class="term unknown">Rustam-‘Alí</mark> as a mark of her noble courage. “This is the Day of Resurrection,” he told her, “the day when <mark class="term unknown">‘all</mark> secrets shall be
    searched out.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn570" name="_ftnref570" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> Not by their outward appearance, but by the character of their
    beliefs and the manner of their lives, does God judge His creatures, be they men or women. Though a maiden of tender age and immature experience, you have
    displayed such vitality and resource as few men could hope to surpass.” He granted her request, and warned her not to exceed the bounds their Faith had
    imposed upon them. “We are called upon to defend our lives,” he reminded her, “against a treacherous assailant, and not to wage holy war against him.”
</p><p>For a period of no less than five months, that maiden continued to withstand with unrivalled heroism the forces of the enemy. Disdainful of food and sleep,
    she toiled with fevered earnestness for the Cause she most loved. She quickened, by the example of her splendid daring, the courage of the few who wavered,
    and reminded them of the duty each was expected to fulfil. The sword she wielded remained, throughout that period, by her side. In the brief intervals of
    sleep she was able to obtain, she was seen with her head resting upon her sword and her shield serving as a covering for her body. Every one of her
    companions was assigned to a particular post which he was expected to guard and defend, while that fearless maid alone was free to move in whatever
    direction she pleased. Always in the thick and forefront of the turmoil that raged round her, Zaynab was ever ready to rush to the rescue of whatever post
    the assailant was threatening, and to lend her assistance to any one of those who needed either her encouragement or support. As the end of her life
    approached, her enemies discovered her secret, and continued, despite their knowledge that she was a maid, to dread her influence and to tremble at her
    approach. The <a name="Page_552"></a>shrill sound of her voice was sufficient to strike consternation into their hearts and to fill them with despair.
</p>One day, seeing that her companions were being suddenly enveloped by the forces of the enemy, Zaynab ran in distress to <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> and, flinging herself at his
    feet, implored him, with tearful eyes, to allow her to rush forth to their aid. “My life, I feel, is nearing its end,” she added. “I may myself fall
    beneath the sword of the assailant. Forgive, I entreat you, my trespasses, and intercede for me with my Master, for whose sake I yearn to lay down my
    life.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> was too much overcome with emotion to reply. Encouraged by his silence, which she interpreted to mean that he consented to grant her appeal, she
    leaped out of the gate and, raising seven times the cry “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!” rushed to stay the hand that had already slain a number of her companions.
    “Why befoul by your deeds the fair name of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>?” she shouted, as she flung herself upon them. “Why flee abjectly from before our face, if you be speakers
    of truth?” She ran to the barricades which the enemy had erected, routed those who guarded the first three of the defences, and was engaging in overcoming
    the fourth, when, beneath a shower of bullets, she dropped dead upon the ground. Not a single voice among her opponents dared question her chastity or
    ignore the sublimity of her faith and the enduring traits of her character. Such was her devotion that after her death no less than twenty women of her
    acquaintance embraced the Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. To them she had ceased to be the peasant girl they had known; she was the very incarnation of the noblest
    principles of human conduct, a living embodiment of the spirit which only a Faith such as hers could manifest.
</p>The messengers who acted as intermediaries between <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> and his companions were one day directed to inform the guards of the barricades to carry out the
<mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s injunction to His followers and to repeat nineteen times, each night, each of the following invocations: “<mark class="term correct">Alláh-u-Akbar</mark>,”<a href="#_ftn571" name="_ftnref571" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> “<mark class="term unknown">Alláh-u-‘Aẓam</mark>,”<a href="#_ftn572" name="_ftnref572" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> “<mark class="term unknown">Alláh-u-Ajmal</mark>,”<a href="#_ftn573" name="_ftnref573" title="">[************************]</a> “<mark class="term unknown">Alláh-u-Abhá</mark>,”<a href="#_ftn574" name="_ftnref574" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> and “<mark class="term unknown">Alláh-u-A<u>th</u>ar</mark>.”    <a href="#_ftn575" name="_ftnref575" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> The very night the behest was received, all the <a name="Page_553"></a>defenders of the barricades joined in shouting those words simultaneously. So loud and compelling was that cry that the enemy was rudely awakened from
    sleep, abandoned the camp in horror, and, hurrying to the environs of the governor’s residence, sought shelter in the neighbouring houses. A few were so
    shocked with terror that they instantly dropped dead. A considerable number of the inhabitants of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> fled, <mark class="term unknown">panic-stricken</mark>, to the adjoining villages.
    Many believed that stupendous uproar to be a sign heralding the Day of Judgment; to others it signified the sending forth, on the part of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, of a
    fresh summons which they felt would be the prelude to a sudden offensive against them more terrible than any they had yet experienced.
<p></p>“What,” <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> was heard to remark, when informed of the terror that sudden invocation had inspired, “if I had been permitted by my Master to wage holy war
    against these cowardly miscreants! I am bidden by Him to instil into men’s hearts the ennobling principles of charity and love, and to refrain from all
    unnecessary violence. My aim and that of my companions is, and ever will be, to serve our sovereign loyally and to be the <mark class="term unknown">well-wishers</mark> of his people. Had I
    chosen to follow in the footsteps of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, I should, as long as I live, have continued to remain the object of the slavish adoration of
    this people. Never shall I be willing to barter for all the treasures and honours this world can give me, the undying loyalty I bear His Cause.”
<p></p><p>The memory of that night still lingers in the minds of those who experienced its awe and terror. I have heard several <mark class="term unknown">eye-witnesses</mark> express in glowing
    terms the contrast between the tumult and disorder that reigned in the camp of the enemy and the atmosphere of reverent devotion that filled the fort.
    While those in the fort were invoking the name of God and praying for His guidance and mercy, their opponents, officers and men alike, were absorbed in
    acts of debauchery and shame. Though worn and exhausted, the occupants of the fort continued to observe their vigils and chant such anthems as the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had
    instructed them to repeat. The camp of the enemy at that same hour resounded with peals of noisy laughter, with imprecations and blasphemies. That night in
    particular, no sooner had the invocation <a name="Page_554"></a>pealed out than the dissolute officers, who were holding their <mark class="term unknown">wine-glasses</mark> in their hands,
    dropped them instantly to the ground and rushed out headlong, in bare feet, as if stunned by that stentorian outcry. Gambling tables were overturned in the
    midst of the disorder that ensued. Half dressed and bareheaded, a number ran out into the wilderness, while others betook themselves in haste to the homes
    of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> and roused them from their sleep. Alarmed and overawed, these began to direct their fiercest invectives against one another for having
    kindled the fire of such great mischief.
</p>As soon as the enemy had discovered the purpose of that loud clamour, they returned to their posts, reassured, though greatly humiliated, by their
    experience. The officers directed a certain number of their men to lie in ambush and to fire in any direction from which those voices might again proceed.
    Every night they succeeded in this way in slaying a number of the companions. Undeterred by the losses they were repeatedly sustaining, <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>’s supporters
    continued to raise, with undiminished fervour, their invocation, despising the perils which the offering of the prayer involved. As their number
    diminished, that prayer grew louder and acquired added poignancy. Even the imminence of death was powerless to induce the intrepid defenders of the fort to
    give up what they deemed the noblest and most powerful reminder of their Beloved.
<p></p>The contest was still raging when <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> was moved to address his written message to <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>. “The subjects of your Imperial Majesty,” he
    wrote him, “regard you both as their temporal ruler and as the supreme custodian of their Faith. They appeal to you for justice, and look upon you as the
    supreme protector of their rights. Our controversy primarily concerned the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> only, and under no circumstances involved either your
government or people. I myself was summoned by your predecessor to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and was requested by him to set forth the basic claims of my Faith. The late    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> was entirely satisfied, and highly commended my efforts. I resigned myself to leave my home and settle in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, with no other intention than
    that of abating the fury that raged round my person and of <a name="Page_555"></a>extinguishing the fire which the <mark class="term unknown">mischief-makers</mark> had kindled. Though free
    to return to my home, I preferred to remain in the capital, wholly relying upon the justice of my sovereign. In the early days of your reign, the
    <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, while the <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> upheaval was still in progress, suspected me of treason and determined to destroy my life. Finding no one in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> able
    to protect me, I determined, in <mark class="term unknown">self-defence</mark> to flee to <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, where I resumed my labours and strove with all my might to advance the true interest of
    <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. I was pursuing my work when <mark class="term unknown">Majdu’d-Dawlih</mark> arose against me. I several times appealed to him to exercise moderation and justice, but he refused to
    grant my request. Instigated by the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, and encouraged by the adulation they lavished upon him, he determined to arrest me. My friends
    intervened and attempted to stay his hand. He continued to rouse the people against me, and they in their turn have acted in a manner that has led to the
    present situation. Your Majesty has until now refrained from extending his gracious assistance to us, who are the innocent victims of such ferocious
    cruelty. Our enemies have even sought to represent our Cause, in the eyes of your Majesty, as a conspiracy against the authority with which you have been
    invested. Surely every unbiased observer will readily admit that we cherish in our hearts no such intention. Our sole aim is to advance the best interests
    of your government and people. I and my principal companions hold ourselves in readiness to leave for <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, that we may, in your presence as well as in
    that of our chief opponents, establish the soundness of our Cause.”
<p></p><p>Not content with his own petition, he bade his leading supporters address similar appeals to the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and stress his request for justice.
</p>No sooner had the messenger who was carrying those petitions to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> set out on his way than he was seized and brought back into the presence of the
    governor. Infuriated by the action of his opponents, he ordered the messenger to be immediately put to death. He destroyed the petitions and in their stead
    wrote the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> letters which he loaded with abuse and insult, and, adding the signatures of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> and his chief companions, despatched them to
    <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. <a name="Page_556"></a>The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> was so indignant after the perusal of these insolent petitions that he gave orders for the immediate despatch of two regiments equipped
    with guns and munitions to <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, commanding that not one supporter of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> be allowed to survive.
<p></p>The news of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s martyrdom had meanwhile reached the <mark class="term unknown">hard-pressed</mark> occupants of the fort through <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, brother of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s
    amanuensis, who had arrived from <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark> on his way to <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>. The news spread among the enemy and was welcomed by them with shouts of wild
    delight. They hastened to ridicule and hurl their taunts at the efforts of His adherents. “For what reason,” they cried in haughty scorn, “will you
    henceforth be willing to sacrifice yourselves? He in whose path you long to lay down your lives, has himself fallen a victim to the bullets of a triumphant
    foe. His body is even now lost both to his enemies and to his friends. Why persist in your stubbornness when a word is sufficient to deliver you from your
    woes?” However much they strove to shake the confidence of the bereaved community, they failed, in the end, to induce the feeblest among them either to
    desert the fort or to recant his Faith.
<p></p>The <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark> was meanwhile urging his sovereign to despatch further reinforcements to <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark>, at the head of five
    regiments and equipped with a considerable amount of arms and munitions, was finally commissioned to demolish the fort and wipe out its occupants.
<p></p>During the twenty days that hostilities were suspended, <mark class="term misspelled">Azíz</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Azíz</mark><mark class="term unknown"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Mukrí</mark>, surnamed <mark class="term unknown">Sardár-i-Kull</mark>, who was on a military mission to <mark class="term correct">Íraván</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn576" name="_ftnref576" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> arrived at <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> and succeeded in meeting <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> through his host, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. The latter related to <mark class="term misspelled">Azíz</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Azíz</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> the circumstances of a touching interview he had had with <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, when he had obtained all the
    information he required regarding the intentions and proposals of the besieged. “Should the government,” <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark><a name="Page_557"></a>had told him,
    “refuse to entertain my appeal, I am willing, with its permission, to depart with my family to a place beyond the confines of this land. Should it refuse
to grant even this request and persist in attacking us, we should feel constrained to arise and defend ourselves.” <mark class="term misspelled">Azíz</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Azíz</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> assured <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> that he would do all in his power to induce the authorities to effect a speedy solution of this problem. No sooner had <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>
    retired than <mark class="term misspelled">Azíz</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Azíz</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was surprised by the <mark class="term correct">farrá<u>sh</u></mark><a href="#_ftn577" name="_ftnref577" title="">[*************************]</a> of the
    <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, who had come to arrest <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> and to conduct him to the capital. He was seized with great fear and, in order to avert any
    suspicion from himself, began to abuse <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> and to denounce him openly before the <mark class="term correct">farrá<u>sh</u></mark>. By this means he was able to ward off the danger that
    threatened his own life.
<p></p>The arrival of the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark> was the signal for the resumption of hostilities on a scale such as <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> had never before experienced. Seventeen regiments
of cavalry and infantry had rallied to his standard, and fought under his command.    <a href="#_ftn578" name="_ftnref578" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> No less than fourteen guns were, at his orders, directed against the fort.
    Five additional regiments, which the <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark> had recruited from the neighbourhood, were being trained by him as reinforcements. The very night he arrived, he
    issued orders that the trumpets be sounded as a signal for the resumption of the attack. The officers in charge of his artillery were commanded to open
fire instantly upon the besieged. The booming of the cannons, which could be heard distinctly at a distance of about fourteen <mark class="term correct">farsangs</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn579" name="_ftnref579" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> had scarcely begun when <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> ordered his companions to make use of the two
    guns they themselves had constructed. One of them was transported to a high position commanding the <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark>’s headquarters. A ball struck his tent and
    mortally <a name="Page_558"></a>wounded his steed. The enemy was meanwhile directing, with unrelenting fury, its fire upon the fort, and had succeeded in
    killing a large number of its occupants.
<p></p>As the <mark class="term unknown">days-went</mark> by; it became increasingly evident that the forces under the command of the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark>, in spite of their great superiority in number,
    equipment, and training, were unable to achieve the victory they had fondly anticipated. The death of Farru<u>kh</u><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, son of <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>
    and brother of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, one of the generals of the enemy’s army, aroused the indignation of the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, who addressed a strongly
    worded communication to the commanding officer, reprimanding him for his failure to force the besieged to an unconditional surrender. “You have sullied the
    fair name of our country,” he wrote him, “have demoralised the army, and have wasted the lives of its ablest officers.” He was bidden enforce the strictest
    discipline among his subordinates and cleanse his camp from every stain of debauchery and vice. He was, moreover, urged to take counsel with the chiefs of
    the people of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, and was warned that, failing to achieve his end, he would be degraded from his position. “If your combined endeavours,” he added,
    “prove powerless to force their submission, I myself will proceed to <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, and will order a wholesale massacre of its inhabitants, irrespective of their
    position or belief. A town that can bring so much humiliation to the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and distress to his people is utterly unworthy of the clemency of our
    sovereign.”
<p></p><p>In a frenzy of despair, the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark> summoned all the <mark class="term correct">kad-<u>kh</u>udás</mark><a href="#_ftn580" name="_ftnref580" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> and
    chiefs of the people, showed them the text of that letter, and by his earnest entreaties succeeded in rousing them to immediate action. The next day every
    <mark class="term unknown">able-bodied</mark> man in <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> had enlisted under the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark>’s standard. Headed by their <mark class="term correct">kad-<u>kh</u>udás</mark> and preceded by four regiments, a vast multitude
    of people marched, to the sound of a flourish of trumpets and the beating of drums, in the direction of the fort. Undaunted by their clamour, the
    companions of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> raised simultaneously the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!” then poured out of the gates and flung themselves upon them. That encounter was
    the fiercest and most desperate engagement that had yet <a name="Page_559"></a>been experienced. The flower of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>’s supporters fell on that day,
    victims to a ruthless carnage. Many a son was butchered in circumstances of unbridled cruelty under the eyes of his mother, while sisters gazed with horror
    and anguish upon the heads of their brothers raised on spears and brutally disfigured by the weapons of their foes. In the midst of a tumult in which the
    boisterous enthusiasm of the companions of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> faced the fury and barbarism of an exasperated enemy, the voices of women, who were struggling side by
    side with the men, could be heard from time to time, animating the zeal of their <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>. The victory that was miraculously achieved on that day
    was, in no small measure, attributable to the shouts of exultation which those women raised in the face of a mighty foe, shouts which acquired added
    poignancy by their own acts of heroism and <mark class="term unknown">self-sacrifice</mark>. Disguised in the garb of men, some had rushed forward, in their eagerness to supplant their
    fallen brethren, while the rest were seen carrying on their shoulders skins full of water, with which they strove to allay the thirst, and revive the
    strength, of the wounded. Confusion reigned meanwhile in the camp of the enemy. Deprived of water, and distressed by defection in their ranks, they fought
    a losing battle, unable to retreat and impotent to conquer. No less than three hundred companions quaffed, that day, the cup of martyrdom.
</p>One of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>’s supporters was a man named <mark class="term correct">Muḥsin</mark>, whose function it was to sound the <mark class="term correct">a<u>dh</u>án</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn581" name="_ftnref581" title="">[**************************]</a> His voice was endowed with a quality of warmth and richness that no man in
    the neighbourhood could equal. Its reverberation, as he summoned the faithful to prayer, could be distinctly felt as far as the adjoining villages, and
    penetrated the hearts of those who heard it. Oftentimes did the worshippers in that vicinity, in whose ears the voice of <mark class="term correct">Muḥsin</mark> was ringing, express their
    indignation at the charges of heresy imputed to <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> and his friends. So loud grew their protestations that they eventually reached the ears of the
    leading <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, who, unable himself to impose silence upon them, implored the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark> to devise some means of eradicating from the minds of
    the people the belief in the piety <a name="Page_560"></a>and uprightness of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> and his companions. “Day and night,” he complained, “I strive through
    my public discourse, no less than by private converse with the people, to instil into their minds the conviction that that wretched band is the sworn enemy
    of the Prophet and the wrecker of His Faith. The cry of that evil man, <mark class="term correct">Muḥsin</mark>, robs my words of their influence and nullifies my exertions. To exterminate
    that miserable wretch is surely your first obligation.”
<p></p><p>The <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark> refused at first to entertain his appeal. “You and your like,” he replied, “are to be held responsible for having declared the necessity of waging
    holy war against them. We are but the servants of the government, and our duty is to obey the orders we receive. If you seek, however, to put an end to his
    life, you should be prepared to make the proper sacrifice.” The siyyid immediately understood the purpose of the <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark>’s allusion. He had no sooner regained
his house than he sent him, by the hand of a messenger, the gift of a hundred <mark class="term misspelled">túmans</mark> <mark class="term correction">túmáns</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn582" name="_ftnref582" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a>
</p>The <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark> promptly ordered a number of his men, who were famed for their marksmanship, to lie in wait for <mark class="term correct">Muḥsin</mark> and shoot him when in the act of prayer. It
    was the hour of dawn when, as he raised the cry of “<mark class="term unknown">Lá</mark> Ilah-à-Illa’llah,”<a href="#_ftn583" name="_ftnref583" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> a
    bullet struck him in the mouth and killed him instantly. <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, as soon as he was informed of that cruel act, ordered another of his companions to ascend
    the turret and continue the prayer from where <mark class="term correct">Muḥsin</mark> had left off. Though his life was spared until the cessation of hostilities, he, together with certain
    of his brethren, was made to suffer, eventually, a death no less atrocious than that of his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciple</mark>.
<p></p>As the days of the siege were drawing to a close, <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> urged all those who were betrothed to celebrate their nuptials. For each unmarried youth among the
    besieged he chose a spouse, and, within the limits of the means at his disposal, contributed from his own purse whatever could add to the comfort and
    gladness of the newly married. He sold all the jewels his wife possessed, and, with the money, provided whatever could be obtained to bring happiness and
    pleasure to those he had joined in wedlock. During more than three months these festivities continued, festivities which were <a name="Page_561"></a>intermingled with the terrors and hardships of a <mark class="term unknown">long-protracted</mark> siege. How often did the clamour of an advancing foe drown the acclamations of joy with
    which bride and bridegroom greeted each other! How suddenly was the voice of merriment stilled by the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!” that summoned the
    faithful to arise and repulse the invader! With what tenderness would the bride entreat the bridegroom to tarry awhile longer beside her ere he rushed
    forth to win the crown of martyrdom! “I can spare no time,” he would reply. “I must hasten to obtain the crown of glory. We shall surely meet again on the
    shores of the great Beyond, the home of a blissful and eternal reunion.”
<p></p><p>No less than two hundred youths were joined in wedlock during those tumultuous days. Some a month, others a few days, and still others for but a brief
    moment, were able to tarry undisturbed in the company of their brides; no one among them failed, as the beating of the drum announced the hour of his
    departure, to respond joyously to the call. Each and every one ungrudgingly offered himself as a sacrifice for his true Beloved; all drank, eventually, the
cup of martyrdom. No wonder the spot that has been the theatre of untold sufferings and has witnessed such heroism has been named <mark class="term unknown">Ard-i-A‘lá</mark>    <a href="#_ftn584" name="_ftnref584" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, a title that has remained for all time linked with His own
    blessed name.
</p>Among the companions was a certain <mark class="term correct">Karbilá’í</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Báqí</mark>, the father of seven sons, five of whom <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> joined in wedlock. The nuptial ceremonies were
    hardly at an end when cries of terror suddenly announced the resumption of a fresh offensive against them. They sprang to their feet and, forsaking their
    loved ones, instantly rushed out to repulse the invader. All five fell in turn in the course of that encounter. The eldest of them, a youth greatly
    esteemed for his intelligence, and of renowned courage, was captured and conducted into the presence of the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark>. “Lay him upon the ground,” cried
    the infuriated <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark>, “and kindle upon his breast, which dared nourish so great a love for <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, a fire that shall consume it.” “Wretched man,” burst
    forth the undaunted youth, “no flame that the hands of your men are able to kindle, could destroy the love that <a name="Page_562"></a>glows in my heart.”
    The praise of his Beloved lingered on his lips until the last moment of his life.
<p></p>Among the women who distinguished themselves by the tenacity of their faith was one named <mark class="term unknown">Umm-i-A<u>sh</u>raf</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn585" name="_ftnref585" title="">[***************************]</a> who was newly married when the storm of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> broke out. She was within
    the fort when she gave birth to her son A<u>sh</u>raf. Both mother and child survived the massacre that marked the closing stages of that tragedy. Years
    afterwards, when her son had grown into a youth of great promise, he was involved in the persecutions that afflicted brethren. Unable to persuade him to
    recant, his enemies endeavoured to alarm his mother and convince her of the necessity of saving him, ere it was too late, from his fate. “I will disown you
    as my son,” cried the mother, when brought face to face with him, “if you incline your heart to such evil whisperings and allow them to turn you away from
    the Truth.” Faithful to his mother’s admonitions, A<u>sh</u>raf met his death with intrepid calm. Though herself a witness to the cruelties inflicted on
    her son, she made no lamentation, neither did she shed a tear. This marvellous mother showed a courage and fortitude that amazed the perpetrators of that
    shameless deed. “I have now in mind,” she exclaimed, as she cast a parting glance at the corpse of her son, “the vow I made on <a name="Page_563"></a>the
    day of your birth, while besieged in the fort of <mark class="term unknown">‘Alí-Mardán</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. I rejoice that you, the only son whom God gave me, have enabled me to redeem that
    pledge.”
<p></p><p>My pen is powerless to portray, much less to render befitting tribute to, the consuming enthusiasm that glowed in those valiant hearts. Violent as were the
    winds of adversity they were powerless to quench its flame. Men and women laboured with unabating fervour to strengthen the defences of the fort and
    reconstruct whatever the enemy had demolished. What leisure they could obtain was consecrated to prayer. I very thought, every desire, was subordinated to
    the paramount necessity of guarding their stronghold against the onslaughts of the assailant. The part the women played in these operations was no less
    arduous than that accomplished by their men companions. Every woman, irrespective of rank and age, joined with energy in the common task. They sewed the
    garments, baked the bread, ministered to the sick and wounded, repaired the barricades, cleared away from the courts and terraces the balls and missiles
fired upon them by the enemy, and, last but not least, cheered the faint in heart and animated the faith of the wavering.    <a href="#_ftn586" name="_ftnref586" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> Even the children joined in giving whatever assistance was in their power
    to the common cause, and seemed to be fired by an enthusiasm no less remarkable than that which their fathers and mothers displayed.
</p>Such was the spirit of solidarity that characterised their labours, and such the heroism of their acts, that the enemy was led to believe their number was
    no less than ten thousand. It was generally conceded that a continual supply of provisions found its way, in an unaccountable manner, to the fort, and that
    fresh reinforcements were being steadily despatched from <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, from <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, and from <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>. The power of the besieged seemed to them as
    unshakable as ever, their resources inexhaustible.
<p></p>The <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark>, exasperated by their unyielding tenacity <a name="Page_564"></a>and spurred by the rebukes and protestations of the authorities in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>,
determined to resort to the abject weapons of treachery in order to exact the complete submission of the besieged.    <a href="#_ftn587" name="_ftnref587" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> Firmly convinced of the futility of his efforts to face his opponents in
    the field honourably, he craftily called for the suspension of hostilities, and gave currency to the report that the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> had decided to abandon the
    whole enterprise. He represented his sovereign as having, from the very beginning, discountenanced the idea of extending his support to the forces that
    fought in <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, and of having deplored the shedding of so much blood for so insignificant a cause. The people of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> and the
    surrounding villages were led to believe that <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> had actually ordered the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark> to negotiate a friendly settlement of the issues
    between him and <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, and that it was his intention to put an end, as speedily as possible, to this unhappy state of affairs.
<p></p>Assured that the people had been deceived by his cunning plot, he drew up an appeal for peace, in which he assured <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> of the sincerity of his intention
    of achieving a lasting settlement between him and his supporters. He accompanied that declaration with a sealed copy of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, as a testimony of the
    sacredness of his pledge. “My sovereign,” he added, “has forgiven you. You, as well as your followers, I hereby solemnly declare to be under the protection
    of his Imperial Majesty. This Book of God is my witness that if any of you decide to come out of the fort, you will be safe from any danger.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> reverently received the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> from the hand of the messenger, and, as soon as he had read the appeal, bade its bearer inform his master that he
    would send an answer in the course of the following day. That night he gathered together his chief companions and spoke to them of the misgivings he
    entertained as to the sincerity of the enemy’s declarations. “The treacheries of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> and of <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> <a name="Page_565"></a>are still vivid in our
    minds. That which was perpetrated against them, the same they purpose to perpetrate against us. In deference to the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, however, we shall respond to
    their invitation, and shall despatch to their camp a number of our companions, that thereby their deceitfulness may be exposed.”
</p><p>I have heard <mark class="term correct">Ustád</mark> <mark class="term unknown">Mihr-‘Alíy-i-Haddad</mark>, who survived the massacre of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, relate the following: “I was one of the nine children, none of whom were more
    than ten years old, who accompanied the delegation sent by <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> to the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark>. The rest were men of over eighty years of age. Among them were
    <mark class="term correct">Karbilá’í</mark> <mark class="term unknown">Mawla-Qulí-Áqá-Dada<u>sh</u></mark>, <mark class="term unknown">Darví<u>sh</u>-Salah</mark>, <mark class="term unknown">Muḥammad-Raḥím</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>. <mark class="term unknown">Darví<u>sh</u>-Salah</mark> was a most impressive figure, tall of
    stature, <mark class="term unknown">white-bearded</mark>, and of singular beauty. He was greatly esteemed for his honourable and just conduct. His intervention on behalf of the downtrodden
    invariably received the consideration and sympathy of the authorities concerned. He renounced, after his conversion, all the honours he had received, and,
    though far advanced in age, enrolled himself among the defenders of the fort. He marched before us carrying the sealed <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> as we were led into the
    presence of the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark>.
</p>“Reaching his tent, we stood at its entrance awaiting his orders. To our salute he gave no response, and treated us with marked contempt. He kept us
    standing half an hour before he deigned to address us in a tone of severe reprimand. <mark class="term unknown">‘A</mark> meaner and more shameless people than you,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he cried in haughty
    scorn, <mark class="term unknown">‘has</mark> never been seen!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> He had hurled his denunciations at us when one of the companions, the oldest and feeblest among them, begged to be allowed to
    say a few words to him, and, on obtaining his permission, spoke, unlettered though he was, in a manner that could not fail to excite our profound
    admiration. <mark class="term unknown">‘God</mark> knows,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he pleaded, <mark class="term unknown">‘that</mark> we are, and will ever remain, loyal and <mark class="term unknown">law-abiding</mark> subjects of our sovereign, with no other desire than to
    advance the true interests of his government and people. We have been grievously misrepresented by our <mark class="term unknown">ill-wishers</mark>. No one of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s
    representatives was inclined to protect or befriend us; no one was found to plead our Cause before <a name="Page_566"></a>him. We repeatedly appealed to
    him, but he ignored our entreaty and was deaf to our call. Our enemies, emboldened by the indifference which characterised the attitude of the ruling
    authorities, assailed us from every side, plundered our property, violated the honour of our wives and daughters, and captured our children. Undefended by
    our government and encompassed by our foes, we felt constrained to arise and defend our lives.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“The <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark> turned to his lieutenant and asked him what action he would advise him to take. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> am at a loss,” the <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark> added, <mark class="term unknown">‘as</mark> to the answer I
    should give this man. Were I at heart religious, I would unhesitatingly embrace his cause.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> <mark class="term unknown">‘Nothing</mark> but the sword,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> replied his lieutenant, <mark class="term unknown">‘will</mark> deliver
    us from this abomination of heresy.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> still hold the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> in my hand,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> interposed <mark class="term unknown">Darví<u>sh</u>-Salah</mark>, <mark class="term unknown">‘and</mark> carry the declaration which you, of your
    own accord, chose to make. Are the words we have just heard our reward for having responded to your appeal?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
</p><p>“The <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark>, in a burst of fury, offered that <mark class="term unknown">Darví<u>sh</u>-Salah</mark>’s beard be torn out, and that he, with those who were with him, be thrown into a
    dungeon. I and the rest of the children were scared, and attempted to escape. Raising the cry of <mark class="term misspelled">‘Yá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Yá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> we hurried in the direction of our
    barricades. Some of us were overtaken and made prisoners. As I was fleeing, the man who was pursuing me laid hold of the hem of my garment. I tore myself
    away from him and managed to reach the gate that led to the approaches of the fort, in a state of utter exhaustion. How great was my surprise when I saw
    one of the companions, a man named <mark class="term unknown">Iman-Qulí</mark>, being savagely mutilated by the enemy. I was horrified as I gazed upon that scene, knowing as I did that on
    that very day the cessation of hostilities had been proclaimed and the most solemn pledges given that no acts of violence would be committed. I was soon
    informed that the victim had been betrayed by his brother, who, on the pretext of desiring to speak with him, had handed him over to his persecutors.
</p>“I straightway hastened to <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, who lovingly received me and, wiping the dust from my face, and clothing me with new garments, invited me to be seated
    by his side and bade <a name="Page_567"></a>me tell him the fate of his companions. I described to him all that I had seen. <mark class="term unknown">‘It</mark> is the tumult of the Day of
    Resurrection,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he explained, <mark class="term unknown">‘a</mark> tumult such as the world has never seen before. This is the day on which “man shall fly from his brother, and his mother
    and his father, and his wife and his children.”<a href="#_ftn588" name="_ftnref588" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> This is the day when man,
    not content with having abandoned his brother, sacrifices his substance in order to shed the blood of his nearest kinsman. This is the day when “every
    suckling woman shall forsake her sucking babe; and every woman that hath a burden in her womb shall cast her burden. And thou shalt see men drunken, yet
    they are not drunken; but it is the mighty chastisement of God!”<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>”<a href="#_ftn589" name="_ftnref589" title="">[****************************]</a>Seating himself in the centre of the <mark class="term correct">maydán</mark>,<a href="#_ftn590" name="_ftnref590" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a><mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> summoned his followers.
    On their arrival, he arose and, standing erect in their midst, spoke to them in these words: “I am well pleased with your unflinching endeavours, my
    beloved companions. Our enemies are bent upon our destruction. They harbour no other desire. Their intention was to trick you into coming out of the fort,
    and then to slaughter you mercilessly after their <mark class="term unknown">hearts’</mark> desire. Finding that their treachery has been exposed, they have, in the fury of their rage,
    <mark class="term unknown">ill-treated</mark> and imprisoned the oldest and the youngest among you. It is clear that not until they capture this fort and scatter you, will they lay down
    their arms or cease their persecutions against us. Your continued presence in this fort will eventually cause you to be taken captive by the enemy, who
    will of a certainty dishonour your wives and slay your children. Better is it, therefore, for you to make your escape in the middle of the night and to
    take your wives and children with you. Let each one seek a place of safety until such time as this tyranny shall be overpast. I shall remain alone to face
    the enemy. It were better that my death should allay their thirst for revenge than that you should all perish.”
<p></p><p>The companions were moved to their very depths and, with tears in their eyes, declared their firm resolve to remain, to the end, by his side. “We can never
    consent,” they exclaimed, to abandon you to the mercy of a murderous enemy! Our lives are not more precious than your life, <a name="Page_568"></a>neither
    are our families of a more noble descent than that of your kinsmen. Whatever calamity may yet befall you, is what we shall welcome for ourselves.”
</p><p>All except a few remained true their pledge. These, unable to bear the <mark class="term unknown">ever-increasing</mark> distress of a prolonged siege, and encouraged by the advice <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>
    himself had given them, betook themselves to a place of safety outside the fort, thus separating themselves from the rest of their <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>.
</p>Nerved to a resolve of despair, the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark> ordered all <mark class="term unknown">able-bodied</mark> men in <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> to assemble in the neighbourhood of his camp, ready to receive his
    commands. He reorganised the forces of his regiments, appointed their officers, and added them to the host of fresh recruits that had massed in the town.
    He ordered no less than sixteen regiments, each equipped with ten guns, to march against the fort. Eight of these regiments were charged to attack the fort
    every forenoon, after which the remainder of the forces were to replace them in their offensive until the approach of evening. The <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark> himself took the
    field, and was seen in the forenoon of every day directing the efforts of his host, assuring them of the reward awaiting their success, and warning them of
    the punishment which, in the event of defeat, the sovereign would inflict upon them.
<p></p>For one whole month the siege continued. Not content with attacks by day, the enemy several times attacked them by night also. The fierceness of their
    onslaughts, the overwhelming force of their numbers, and the rapid succession of the onsets, thinned the ranks of the companions and aggravated their
distress. Reinforcements for the enemy continued to pour in from all directions, while the besieged languished in a state of misery and hunger.    <a href="#_ftn591" name="_ftnref591" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><p></p>The <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark> meanwhile decided to strengthen the hands of the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark> by the appointment of <mark class="term unknown">Ḥasan-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term unknown"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Karrúsí</mark>, who was commanded to
    march at the head of two <mark class="term correct">sunní</mark> regiments to <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>. His arrival was the signal for the concentration of the enemy’s artillery on <a name="Page_569"></a>the
    fort. A tremendous bombardment threatened the structure with immediate destruction. It lasted for a number of days, during which the stronghold stood firm
    in spite of the increasing fire which was directed against it. The friends of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> displayed, during those days, a valour and skill that even their
    bitterest foes were compelled to admire.
<p></p>One day, while the bombardment was still in progress, a bullet struck <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> in the right arm, as he was performing his ablutions. Though he ordered his
    servant not to inform his wife of the wound he had received, yet such was the man’s grief that he was powerless to conceal his emotion. His tears betrayed
    his distress, and no sooner had the wife of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> learned of the injury inflicted on her husband than she ran in distress and found him absorbed in prayer
    in a state of unruffled calm. Though bleeding profusely from his wound, his face retained its expression of undisturbed confidence. “Pardon this people, O
    God,” he was heard to say, “for they know not what they do. Have mercy upon them, for they who have led them astray are alone responsible for the misdeeds
    the hands of this people have wrought.”
<p></p><p><mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> sought to calm the agitation that had seized his wife and relatives at the sight of the blood that covered his body. “Rejoice,” he told them, “for I
    am still with you and desire you to be wholly resigned to God’s will. What you now behold is but a drop compared to the ocean of afflictions that will be
    poured forth at the hour of my death. Whatever be His decree, it is our duty to acquiesce and bow down to His will.”
</p><p>No sooner had the news that he had been wounded reached the companions than they laid down their arms and hastened to him. The enemy, meanwhile, taking
advantage of the momentary absence of their adversaries, redoubled their attack upon the fort and were able to force their passage through its gate.    <a href="#_ftn592" name="_ftnref592" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> That day they took captive no less than a hundred of the women and
    children, and plundered all their <a name="Page_570"></a>possessions. Despite the severity of that winter, these captives were left exposed in the open for
    no less than fifteen days and nights to a biting cold such as <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> had rarely experienced. Clad in the thinnest of garments, with no covering to protect
    them, they were abandoned, without food and shelter, in the wilderness. Their only protection was the gauze that covered their heads, with which they
    sought in vain to shield their faces from the icy wind that blew mercilessly upon them. Crowds of women, most of whom were inferior to them in social
    position, flocked from the various quarters of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> to the scene of their sufferings and poured upon them contempt and ridicule. “You have now found your
    god,” they scornfully exclaimed, as they danced wildly around them, “and have been rewarded abundantly by him.” They spat in their faces and heaped upon
    them the foulest invectives.
</p>The capture of the fort, though robbing <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>’s companions of their chief instrument of defence, failed either to daunt their spirit or discourage their
    efforts. All property on which the enemy could lay its hands was plundered, and the women and children who were left defenceless were made captives. The
    rest of the companions, together with the remaining women and children, crowded into the houses that lay in the close vicinity of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>’s residence. They
    were divided into five companies, each consisting of nineteen times nineteen companions. From each of these companies, nineteen would rush forth together
    and, raising with one voice the cry of “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!” would fling themselves into the midst of the enemy and would succeed in scattering its forces.
    The uplifted voices of these <mark class="term unknown">ninety-five</mark> companions would alone prove sufficient to paralyse the efforts, and crush the spirit, of their assailants.
<p></p>This state of affairs continued for a few days, bringing in its wake both humiliation and loss to an enemy that had believed itself capable of achieving
    immediate and signal victory. Many were killed in the course of these encounters. Officers, to the distress of their superiors, were beginning to desert
    their posts, the captains of the artillery were abandoning their guns, whilst the rank and file of the army was demoralised and completely exhausted. The
    <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark><a name="Page_571"></a>was himself weary of the coercive measures to which he had been compelled to resort in order to maintain the discipline
    of his men and to keep unimpaired their efficiency and vigour. He was drive against to take counsel with the remainder of his officers, and to seek a
    desperate remedy for a situation that was fraught with grave danger to his own life no less than to that of the inhabitants of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>. “I am weary,” he
    confessed, “of the grim resistance of this people. They are evidently animated by a spirit which no amount of encouragement from our sovereign can hope to
    call forth in our men. Such <mark class="term unknown">self-renunciation</mark> surely no one in the ranks of our army is able to manifest. No power that I can command is able to arouse my
    men from the slough of despair into which they have fallen. Whether they triumph or fail, these soldiers believe themselves doomed to eternal damnation.”
<p></p><p>Their mature deliberations resulted in the decision to <a name="Page_572"></a>dig out underground passages from the site which their camp occupied to a
    place underneath the quarter in which the dwellings of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>’s adherents were situated. They determined to blow up these houses and by this means to force
    them to an unconditional surrender. For one whole month they laboured to fill these underground passages with all manner of explosives, and continued, at
    the same time, to demolish with fiendish cruelty such houses as remained standing. Wishing to accelerate the work of destruction, the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark> ordered
    the officers in charge of his artillery to direct their fire upon <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>’s residence, as the buildings that intervened between that house and the camp of
    the enemy had been razed to the ground, there remaining no further obstacle in the way of its ultimate destruction.
</p>A section of his dwelling had already collapsed when <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, who was still living within its walls, turned to his wife <mark class="term unknown"><u>Kh</u>adíjih</mark>, who was holding
    <mark class="term correct">Hádí</mark>, their baby, in her arms, and warned her that the day was fast approaching when she and her infant might be taken captive, and bade her be prepared
    for that day. She was giving vent to her distress when a <mark class="term unknown">cannon-ball</mark> struck the room which she occupied, and killed her instantly. Her child, whom she was
    holding to her breast, fell into the brazier beside her, and shortly afterwards died of the injuries he had received, in the house of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark>,
    the <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>.
<p></p><mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, though filled with grief, refused to yield to idle sorrow. “The day whereon I found Thy beloved One, O my God,” he cried, “and recognised in Him
    the Manifestation of Thy eternal Spirit, I foresaw the woes that I should suffer for Thee. Great as have been until now my sorrows, they can never compare
    with the agonies that I would willingly suffer in Thy name. How can this miserable life of mine, the loss of my wife and of my child, and the sacrifice of
    the band of my kindred and companions, compare with the blessings which the recognition of Thy Manifestation has bestowed on me! Would that a myriad lives
    were mine, would that I possessed the riches of the whole earth and its glory, that I might resign them all freely and joyously in Thy path.”
<p></p><p>The tragic loss their beloved leader had sustained, and the grievous wound inflicted upon him, distressed the companions <a name="Page_573"></a>of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>,
    and filled them with burning indignation. They determined to make a last and desperate effort to avenge the blood of their slaughtered brethren. <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>,
    however, dissuaded them from making that attempt, and exhorted them not to hasten the issue of the conflict. He bade them resign themselves to the will of
    God and to remain calm and steadfast to the end, whenever that end might come.
</p>As time went on, their number diminished, their sufferings multiplied, and the area within which they could feel secure was reduced. On the morning of the
    fifth of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’l-Avval</mark><mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’l-Avval</mark>, in the year 1267 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn593" name="_ftnref593" title="">[*****************************]</a><mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, who
    had already, for nineteen days, endured the severe pain caused by his wound, was in the act of prayer and had fallen prostrate upon his face, invoking the
    name of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, when he suddenly passed away.
<p></p>His sudden death came as a severe shock to his kindred and companions. Their grief at the passing of so able, so accomplished, and so inspiring a leader,
    was profound; the loss was irreparable. Two of his companions, <mark class="term unknown">Dín-Muḥammad-Vazír</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mír</mark><mark class="term unknown">Riḍáy-i-Sardár</mark>, straightway undertook, ere the enemy was made
    aware of his death, to inter his remains in a place which neither his kindred nor his friends could suspect. At midnight the body was borne to a room that
    belonged to <mark class="term unknown">Dín-Muḥammad-Vazír</mark>, where it received burial. They demolished that room in order to ensure the safety of the remains from desecration, and
    exercised the utmost care to maintain the secrecy of the spot.
<p></p>More than five hundred women who survived that terrible tragedy were, immediately after the death of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, gathered together in his house. His
    companions, in spite of the death of their leader, continued to face, with undiminished zeal, the forces of their assailants. Of the great multitude that
    had flocked to the standard of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, there remained only two hundred vigorous men; the rest either had died or were utterly incapacitated by the wounds
    they had received.
<p></p>The knowledge of the removal of so inspiring a leader nerved the enemy to resistance and decided them to wipe <a name="Page_574"></a>out what still
    remained of the formidable forces they had been unable to subdue. They launched a general attack, fiercer and more determined than any previous one.
    Animated by the beating of drums and the sound of trumpets, and encouraged by the shouts of exultation raised by the populace, they threw themselves upon
    the companions with unbridled ferocity, resolved not to rest until the whole company had been annihilated. In the face of this fierce onset, the companions
    raised once more the cry of <mark class="term correct">Yá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>!” and rushed forth, undismayed, to continue the heroic struggle until all of them had been either slain or
    captured.
<p></p>That massacre had scarcely been perpetrated when the signal was given for a pillage, unexampled in its scope and ferocity. Had not the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark> issued
    orders to spare what remained of the house and belongings of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, and to refrain from any acts of violence against his kindred, even more dastardly
    attacks would have been made by his rapacious army. His intention was to inform the authorities in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and to seek from them whatever advice they wished
    to give him. He failed, however, to restrain indefinitely the spirit of violence which animated his men. The <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, flushed with the victory
    that had cost them such exertion and loss of life, and which had involved to such an unprecedented degree their reputation and prestige, endeavoured to
    incite the populace to commit every imaginable outrage against the lives of their men captives and the honour of their women. The sentinels who guarded the
    entrance to the house in which <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> had been living, were driven from their posts in the general tumult that ensued. The populace joined hands with the
    army to plunder the property and assail the persons of the few who still survived that memorable struggle. Neither the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark> nor the governor was able
    to allay the thirst for plunder and revenge which had seized the whole town. Order and discipline no longer existed in the midst of the general confusion.
<p></p>The governor of the province was, however, able to induce the officers of the army to gather together the captives into the house of a certain <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Gh</u>ulám</mark> and to keep them in custody until the arrival of fresh instructions from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. <a name="Page_575"></a>The entire company were huddled
    together like sheep in that wretched place, exposed to the cold of a severe winter. The enclosure into which they were crowded was roofless and without
    furniture. For a few days they remained without food. From thence the women were removed to the house of a muJtahid named <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark>, in the hope
    that he would induce them to recant, in return for which they would be offered their freedom. The greedy <mark class="term correct">mujtahid</mark>, however, had, with the aid of his wives,
    his sisters and daughters, succeeded in seizing all they had been allowed to carry with them; had stripped them of their garments, clothed them in the
    meanest attire, and appropriated for himself whatever valuables he could find among their belongings.
<p></p>After suffering untold hardships, these women captives were allowed to join their relatives, on condition that these would undertake full responsibility
    for their future behaviour. The rest were dispersed throughout the neighbouring villages, the inhabitants of which, unlike the people of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, welcomed
    the newcomers with treatment that was at once affectionate and genuine. The family of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, however, was detained in <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> until the arrival of definite
    instructions from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>.
<p></p>As to the wounded, they were placed in custody until such time as the authorities in the capital should send directions as to how they were to be treated.
    Meanwhile the severity of the cold to which they were exposed and the cruelties they underwent were such that within a few days they had all perished.
<p></p>The rest of the captives were delivered by the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark> into the hands of the Karrusi, the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>amsíh</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>amsih</mark>, and the <mark class="term misspelled">Iráqí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Iráqí</mark> regiments, with orders that they
be immediately executed. They were conducted in procession, to the accompaniment of drums and trumpets, to the camp where the army was stationed.    <a href="#_ftn594" name="_ftnref594" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> All these regiments combined to add <a name="Page_576"></a>to the horror
    of the abominations perpetrated against the poor sufferers. Armed with their lances and spears, they flung themselves upon the <mark class="term unknown">seventy-six</mark> companions who
    still remained, piercing and mutilating their bodies with a savage ruthlessness that excelled the dark deeds of even the most refined <mark class="term unknown">torture-mongers</mark> of
    their race. The spirit of revenge which that day dominated those barbarous men passed all bounds. Regiment vied with regiment in committing the foulest
    atrocities which their ingenious minds could devise. They were preparing to swoop afresh upon their victims when a certain <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥusayn</mark>, father of
    <mark class="term unknown">‘Abá-Básir</mark>, sprang to his feet and, raising the call of the <mark class="term correct">a<u>dh</u>án</mark>,<a href="#_ftn595" name="_ftnref595" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a>
    thrilled the multitude that had gathered about him. Though in the hour of his death, such were the fervour and majesty with which he pealed out the words
    “<mark class="term correct">Alláh-u-Akbar</mark>,”<a href="#_ftn596" name="_ftnref596" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> that the entire <mark class="term misspelled">Iráqí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Iráqí</mark> regiment immediately proclaimed
    their refusal to continue participating in such shameful deeds. Deserting their posts, and raising the cry “<mark class="term correct">Yá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>!” they fled from that place in horror
and disgust. “Accursed be the <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Tumán</mark>!” they were heard to exclaim, as they turned their backs on that scene of bloodshed and horror. “That wretch    <a name="Page_577"></a>has deceived us! With devilish persistence he sought to convince us of this people’s disloyalty to the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> and to his kindred.
    Never, though we all be slain, will we consent to assist in such criminal deeds.”
<p></p><p>A number of these captives were blown from guns; others were stripped naked, <mark class="term unknown">ice-cold</mark> water was poured upon their bodies, and they were lashed severely.
    Still others were smeared with treacle and left to perish in the snow. Despite the shame and cruelties they were made to suffer, not one of these captives
    was known either to recant or to utter one angry word against his persecutors. Not even a whisper of discontent escaped their lips, nor did their
    countenances betray a shadow of regret or grief. No amount of adversity could succeed in darkening the light that shone in those faces; no words, however
    insulting, could disturb the serenity of their expressions.<a href="#_ftn597" name="_ftnref597" title="">[******************************]</a>No sooner had the persecutors finished their work than they began to seek for the body of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, the place of whose burial the companions had carefully
    concealed. The most inhuman tortures had proved powerless to induce them to disclose the identity of that spot. The governor, exasperated by the failure of
    his search, asked that the <mark class="term unknown">seven-year-old</mark> son of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>, whose name was <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, be brought to him that he might attempt to induce him to disclose the
    secret.<a href="#_ftn598" name="_ftnref598" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> My son, he said, as he gently caressed him, “I am filled with
    grief at the knowledge of all the afflictions that have been the lot of your parents. Not I, but the <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, <a name="Page_578"></a>should be
    held responsible for the abominations that have been committed. I am now willing to accord the remains of your father a befitting burial, and wish to atone
    for the shameful deeds that have been perpetrated against him.” By his gentle insinuations, he succeeded in getting the child to reveal the secret, and
    thereupon sent his men to fetch the body. No sooner had the object of his desire been delivered into his hands than he ordered that it be dragged with a
    rope, to the sound of drums and trumpets, through the streets of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>. For three days and three nights, unspeakable injuries were heaped upon the body,
    which lay exposed to the eyes of the people in the <mark class="term correct">maydán</mark>.<a href="#_ftn599" name="_ftnref599" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> On the third
    night, it was reported that a number of horsemen had succeeded in carrying away the remnants of the corpse to a place of safety in the direction of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>.
    As to <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>’s kinsmen, orders were received from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> to conduct them to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> and to deliver them into the hands of the governor. There they
    languished in poverty and misery. Whatever possessions still remained to them the governor seized for himself, and condemned the victims of his rapacity to
    seek shelter in a ruined and dilapidated house. <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark>’s youngest son, <mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark>, died <a name="Page_579"></a>of the privations he and his family were made to
    suffer, and was buried in the very midst of the ruins that had served as his shelter.
</p>I was privileged, nine years after the termination of that memorable struggle, to visit <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> and witness the scene of those terrible butcheries. I beheld
    with grief and horror the ruins of the fort of <mark class="term unknown">‘Alí-Mardán</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, and trod the ground that had been saturated with the blood of its immortal
    defenders. I could discern on its gates and walls traces of the carnage that marked its surrender to the enemy, and could discover upon the very stones
    that had served as barricades, stains of the blood that had been so profusely shed in that neighbourhood.
<p></p>As to the number of those who fell in the course of these encounters, no accurate estimate has as yet been made. So numerous were those who participated in
    that struggle, and <a name="Page_580"></a>so prolonged the siege which they withstood, that to ascertain their names and number would be a task that I
    would hesitate to undertake. A tentative list of such names, which readers might do well to consult, has been prepared by <mark class="term correct">Ismu’lláhu’l-Mím</mark> and
    <mark class="term correct">Ismu’lláhu’l-Asad</mark>. Many and conflicting are the reports as to the exact number of those who struggled and fell under the banner of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>. Some
    have estimated that there were as many as a thousand martyrs; according to others, they were more numerous. I have heard it stated that one of the
    companions of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> who undertook to record the names of those who had suffered martyrdom, had left a written statement in which he had computed the
    number of those who had fallen prior to the death of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> to be a thousand, five hundred and <mark class="term unknown">ninety-eight</mark>, whilst those who had suffered martyrdom
    afterwards were thought to have been in all two hundred and two persons.
<p></p>For the account I have related of the happenings of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> I am primarily indebted to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘Alíy-i-Tabíb-i-Zanjání</mark>, to <mark class="term unknown">‘Abá-Básir</mark>, and to <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>
    A<u>sh</u>raf, all martyrs of the Faith, with each of whom I was closely acquainted. The rest of my narrative is based upon the manuscript which a certain
    <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Ḥusayn-i-Zanjání</mark> wrote and sent to the presence of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, in which he recorded all the information he could glean from different sources
    regarding the events connected with that episode.
<p></p>What I have related of the struggle of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> has been similarly inspired, to a very great extent, by the written account sent to the Holy Land by a
    certain <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term unknown">Abú-Tálib-i-<u>Sh</u>áhmírzádí</mark>, as well as by the brief survey prepared here by one of the believers named <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Ḥaydar-‘Alíy-i-Ardistání</mark>. I
    have, moreover, ascertained certain facts connected with that struggle from persons who actually participated in it, such as <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Muḥammad-Ṣádiq-i-Muqaddas</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-Furú<u>gh</u>í</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Majíd</mark>, father of <mark class="term misspelled">Badí</mark><mark class="term correction">Badí‘</mark> and martyr to the Faith.
<p></p>As to the events relating to the life and deeds of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, I have obtained my information regarding what took place in <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark> from <mark class="term unknown">Riḍá’r-Rúh</mark>, who was one of
    his intimate companions. As to the later stages of that struggle in <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, my narrative is mainly drawn from such information as I <a name="Page_581"></a>could gather from the detailed account sent to the Holy Land by a believer of that town, named <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Shafi</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>afí‘</mark>, who had carefully investigated the matter and
    had reported it to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. Whatever my pen has failed to record, future generations will, I hope, gather together and preserve for posterity. Many, I
    confess, are the gaps in this narrative, for which I beg the indulgence of my readers. It is my earnest hope that these gaps may be filled by those who
will, after me, arise to compile an exhaustive and befitting account of these stirring events, the significance of which we can as yet but dimly discern.    <a name="Page_582"></a>CHAPTER XXV: <mark class="term correct">BAHÁ’U’LLÁH</mark>’S JOURNEY TO <mark class="term correct">KARBILÁ</mark>Ever since I began the writing of my narrative, it has been my firm intention to include, in such accounts as I might be able to relate of the early days
    of this Revelation, those gems of inestimable value which it has been my privilege to hear, from time to time, from the lips of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. These words,
    some of which were addressed to me alone, others which I shared with my <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> as we sat in His presence, are mainly concerned with the very
    episodes I have essayed to describe. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s comments on the conference of <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark>, and His references to the tumult that marked its closing
    stages, to which I have referred in a preceding chapter, are but instances of the passages with which I hope to enrich and ennoble my narrative.
<p></p>Upon the termination of the description of the struggle of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, I was ushered into His presence, and received, together with a number of other
    believers, the blessings which on two occasions He deigned to confer upon us. Both visits took place during the four days which <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> chose to tarry
    in the home of <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark>. On the second and fourth nights after His arrival at His brother’s house, which fell on the seventh day of the month of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádiyu’l-Avval</mark><mark class="term correction">Jamádíyu’l-Avval</mark>, in the year 1306 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn600" name="_ftnref600" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> I, together with a number of
    pilgrims from <mark class="term unknown">Sarvistán</mark> and <mark class="term unknown">Fárán</mark>, as well as a few resident believers, was admitted into His presence. The words He spoke to us lie for ever engraved upon
    my heart, and I feel it my duty to my readers to share with them the gist of His talk.
<p></p>“Praise be to God,” He said, “that whatever is essential for the believers in this Revelation to be told has been revealed. Their duties have been clearly
    defined, and the deeds they are expected to perform have been plainly set forth in <a name="Page_583"></a>Our Book. Now is the time for them to arise and
    fulfil their duty. Let them translate into deeds the exhortations We have given them. Let them beware lest the love they bear God, a love that glows so
    brightly in their hearts, cause them to transgress the bounds of moderation, and to overstep the limits We have set for them. In regard to this matter, We
    wrote thus, while in <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, to <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Músáy-i-Qumí</mark>: <mark class="term unknown">‘Such</mark> is to be the restraint you should exercise that if you be made to quaff from the <mark class="term unknown">well-springs</mark>
    of faith and certitude all the rivers of knowledge, your lips must never be allowed to betray, to either friend or stranger, the wonder of the draught of
    which you have partaken. Though your heart be aflame with His love, take heed lest any eye discover your inner agitation, and though your soul be surging
    like an ocean, suffer not the serenity of your countenance to be disturbed, nor the manner of your behaviour to reveal the intensity of your emotions.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“God knows that at no time did We attempt to conceal Ourself or hide the Cause which We have been bidden to proclaim. Though not wearing the garb of the
    people of learning, We have again and again faced and reasoned with men of great scholarship in both <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, and have succeeded in persuading
    them of the truth of this Revelation. We never flinched in Our determination; We never hesitated to accept the challenge from whatever direction it came.
    To whomsoever We spoke in those days, We found him receptive to our Call and ready to identify himself with its precepts. But for the shameful behaviour of
    the people of <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark>, who sullied by their deeds the work We had accomplished, <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> would have been entirely won to this Cause and would have
    been accounted by this time among its leading strongholds.
</p>At a time when the forces of Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> had besieged the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, We resolved to depart from <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> and lend Our assistance to its heroic
    defenders. We had intended to send <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>, one of Our companions, in advance of Us, and to request him to announce Our approach to the besieged.
Though encompassed by the forces of the enemy, We had decided to throw in Our lot with those steadfast companions, and to risk the dangers with which    <a name="Page_584"></a>they were confronted. This, however, was not to be. The hand of Omnipotence spared Us from their fate and preserved Us for the work
    We were destined to accomplish. In pursuance of God’s inscrutable wisdom, the intention We had formed was, before Our arrival at the fort, communicated by
    certain inhabitants of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, the governor of <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark>, who sent his men to intercept Us. While We were resting and taking Our tea, We found
    Ourselves suddenly surrounded by a number of horsemen, who seized Our belongings and captured Our steeds. We were given, in exchange for Our own horse, a
    poorly saddled animal which We found it extremely uncomfortable to ride. The rest of Our companions were conducted, handcuffed, to <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>
    succeeded, in spite of the tumult Our arrival had raised, and in the face of the opposition of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark>, in releasing Us from their grasp and in
    conducting Us to his own house. He extended to Us the warmest hospitality. Occasionally he yielded to the pressure which the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> were continuously
    bringing to bear upon him, and felt himself powerless to defeat their attempts to harm Us. We were still in his house when the <mark class="term unknown">Sardár</mark>, who had joined the
    army in <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, returned to <mark class="term correct">Ámul</mark>. No sooner was he informed of the indignities We had suffered than he rebuked <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> for the weakness he had shown
    in protecting Us from Our enemies. <mark class="term unknown">‘Of</mark> what importance,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he indignantly demanded, <mark class="term unknown">‘are</mark> the denunciations of this ignorant people? Why is it that you have
    allowed yourself to be swayed by their clamour? You should have been satisfied with preventing the party from reaching their destination and, instead of
    detaining them in this house, you should have arranged for their safe and immediate return to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“Whilst in <mark class="term misspelled">Sarí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sárí</mark>, We were again exposed to the insults of the people. Though the notables of that town were, for the most part, Our friends and had on
    several occasions met Us in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, no sooner had the townspeople recognised Us, as We walked with <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> in the streets, than they began to hurl their
    invectives at Us. The cry <mark class="term misspelled">‘Babi</mark> <mark class="term correction">Bábí</mark>! <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> greeted Us wherever We went. We were unable to escape their bitter denunciations.
</p>“In <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> We were twice imprisoned as a result of Our <a name="Page_585"></a>having risen to defend the cause of the innocent against a ruthless
    oppressor. The first confinement to which We were subjected followed the slaying of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Taqíy-i-Qazvíní</mark>, and was occasioned by the assistance We were
    moved to extend to those upon whom a severe punishment had been undeservedly inflicted. Our second imprisonment, infinitely more severe, was precipitated
    by the attempt which irresponsible followers of the Faith made on the life of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>. That event led to Our banishment to <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>. Soon
    after Our arrival, We betook Ourself to the mountains of <mark class="term unknown">Kurdistán</mark>, where We led for a time a life of complete solitude. We sought shelter upon the summit
    of a remote mountain which lay at some three <mark class="term unknown">days’</mark> distance from the nearest human habitation. The comforts of life were completely lacking. We remained
    entirely isolated from Our fellow men until a certain <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl</mark> discovered Our abode and brought Us the food We needed.
<p></p><mark class="term unknown">‘Upon</mark> Our return to <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>, We found, to Our great astonishment, that the Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had been sorely neglected, that its influence had waned,
    that its very name had almost sunk into oblivion. We arose to revive His Cause and to save it from decay and corruption. At the time when ear and
    perplexity had taken fast hold of Our companions, We reasserted, with fearlessness and determination, its essential verities, and summoned all those who
    had become lukewarm to espouse with enthusiasm the Faith they had so grievously neglected. We sent forth Our appeal to the peoples of the world, and
    invited them to fix their gaze upon the light of His Revelation.
<p></p>“After Our departure from Adrianople, a discussion arose among the government officials in Constantinople as to whether We and Our companions should not be
    thrown into the sea. The report of such a discussion reached Persia, and gave rise to a rumour that We had actually suffered that fate. In <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>
    particularly, Our friends were greatly perturbed. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad-i-Az<u>gh</u>andí</mark>, as soon as he was informed of this news, was reported to have asserted
    that under no circumstances could he credit such a rumour. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> Revelation of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he said, <mark class="term unknown">‘must</mark>, if this be true, be regarded as utterly devoid of
    foundation.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The news of Our safe arrival <a name="Page_586"></a>in the <mark class="term unknown">prison-city</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Akká</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Akká</mark> rejoiced the hearts of Our friends, deepened the admiration of
    the believers of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> for the faith of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, and increased their confidence him.
<p></p>“From Our Most Great Prison We were moved to address to the several rulers and crowned heads of the world Epistles in which We summoned them to arise and
    embrace the Cause of God. To the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> of Persia We sent Our messenger <mark class="term misspelled">Badí</mark><mark class="term correction">Badí‘</mark>, into whose hands We entrusted the Tablet. It was he who raised it aloft
    before the eyes of the multitude and, with uplifted voice, appealed to his sovereign to heed the words that Tablet contained. The rest of the Epistles
    likewise reached their destination. To the Tablet We addressed to the Emperor of France, an answer was received from his minister, the original of which is
    now in the possession of the Most Great Branch.<a href="#_ftn601" name="_ftnref601" title="">[*******************************]</a> To him We addressed
    these words: <mark class="term unknown">‘Bid</mark> the high priest, O Monarch of France, to cease ringing his bells, for, lo! the Most Great Bell, which the hands of the will of the Lord
    thy God are ringing, is made manifest in the person of His chosen One.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The Epistle We addressed to the Czar of Russia, alone failed to reach it
    destination. Other Tablets, however, have reached him, and that Epistle will eventually be delivered into his hands.
<p></p>“Be thankful to God for having enabled you to recognise His Cause. Whoever has received this blessing must, prior to his acceptance, have performed some
    deed which, though he himself was unaware of its character, was ordained by God as a means whereby he has been guided to find and embrace the Truth. As to
    those who have remained deprived of such a blessing, their acts alone have hindered them from recognising the truth of this Revelation. We cherish the hope
    that you, who have attained to this light, will exert your utmost to banish the darkness of superstition and unbelief from the midst of the people. May
    your deeds proclaim your faith and enable you to lead the erring into the paths of eternal salvation. The memory of this night will never be forgotten. May
    it never be effaced by the passage of time, and may its mention linger for ever on the lips of men.”
<p></p><p>The seventh <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark> after the Declaration of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> <a name="Page_587"></a>fell on the sixteenth day of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádiyu’l-Avval</mark> <mark class="term correction">Jamádíyu’l-Avval</mark> in the year 1267
    A.H.,<a href="#_ftn602" name="_ftnref602" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> a month and a half after the termination of the struggle of
<mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>. That same year, towards the end of spring, in the early days of the month of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>a’bán</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>a‘bán</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn603" name="_ftnref603" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> left the capital for <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. I was, at that time, dwelling
    in <mark class="term misspelled">Kirman<u>sh</u>áh</mark> <mark class="term correction">Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh</mark>, in the company of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s amanuensis, who had been ordered by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> to collect and transcribe all the sacred
    writings, the originals of which were, for the most part, in his possession. I was in <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark>, in the home of my father, when the Seven Martyrs of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>
    met their cruel fate. I subsequently succeeded in leaving for <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, under the pretext of desiring to visit the shrine. Unable to find <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, whom I
    wished to meet, I left for <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>, on the advice of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term unknown">Músáy-i-Qumí</mark>, who informed me that the only person who could enlighten me as to the
    whereabouts of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> was <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark>, who was then living in <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>. With him I again returned to <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, where I was introduced to a certain <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>
    <mark class="term unknown">Abu’l-Qásim-i-’Alaqih-Band-i-Iṣfáhání</mark>, who had previously accompanied <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> on his journey to <mark class="term misspelled">Kirman<u>sh</u>áh</mark> <mark class="term correction">Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh</mark>. <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark> instructed him to conduct me to
    the gate of the city, where he was to inform me of the place where <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> was residing, and to arrange for my departure for <mark class="term correct">Hamadán</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Abu’l-Qásim</mark>, in turn, referred me to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term unknown">Muḥammad-‘Alíy-Tabíb-i-Zanjání</mark>, whom he said I was sure to find in <mark class="term correct">Hamadán</mark> and who would direct me to the place
where I could meet <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>. I followed his instructions and was directed by this <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-‘Alí</mark> to meet, in <mark class="term misspelled">Kirman<u>sh</u>áh</mark> <mark class="term correction">Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh</mark>, a certain merchant,    <mark class="term unknown"><u>Gh</u>ulam-Ḥusayn-i-<u>Sh</u>u<u>sh</u>tarí</mark> by name, who would conduct me to the house where <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> was residing.
</p>A few days after my arrival, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> informed me of his having succeeded, while in <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, in teaching the Cause to <mark class="term unknown">Íldírím</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, brother of <u>Kh</u>
anlar <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, to whom he wished to present a copy of the “<mark class="term correct">Dalá’il-i-Sab‘ih</mark>,”    <a href="#_ftn604" name="_ftnref604" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> and expressed his desire that I should be its bearer. <mark class="term unknown">Íldírím</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> was
in those days governor of <mark class="term unknown"><u>Kh</u>urram-Ábád</mark>, in the province of <mark class="term unknown">Luristán</mark>, and had encamped with his army in the mountains <a name="Page_588"></a>of    <mark class="term unknown"><u>Kh</u>avih-Vali<u>sh</u>tar</mark>. I was only too glad to grant his request, and expressed my readiness to start immediately on that journey. With a Kurdish
    guide, we traversed mountains and forests for six days and six nights, until we reached the governor’s headquarters. I delivered the trust into his hands
    and brought back with me for <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> a written message from him expressing his appreciation of the gift and assuring him of his devotion to the Cause
    of its Author.
<p></p>On my return, I received from <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> the joyful tidings of the arrival of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in <mark class="term misspelled">Kirman<u>sh</u>áh</mark><mark class="term correction">Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh</mark>. As we were being ushered into His
    presence, we found Him, it being the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Ramadán</mark><mark class="term correction">Ramaḍán</mark>, engaged in reading the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>, and were blessed by hearing Him read verses of that sacred Book. I
    presented to Him <mark class="term unknown">Íldírím</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>’s written message to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>. “The faith which a member of the <mark class="term correct">Qájár</mark> dynasty professes,” He remarked, after reading the
    letter, “cannot be depended upon. His declarations are insincere. Expecting that the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> will one day assassinate the sovereign, he harbours in his heart
    the hope of being acclaimed by them the successor. The love he professes for the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> is actuated by that motive.” Within a few months we knew the truth of
    His words. This same <mark class="term unknown">Íldírím</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> gave orders that a certain <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term unknown">Basir-i-Hindí</mark>, a fervent adherent of the Faith, should be put to death.
<p></p>It would be appropriate at this juncture to deviate from the course of our narrative and refer briefly to the circumstances of this martyr’s conversion and
death. Among the disciples whom the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had instructed, in the early days of His Mission, to disperse and teach His Cause, was a certain <u>Sh</u>ay    <u>kh</u><mark class="term misspelled">Sa’íd-i-Hindí</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘íd-i-Hindí</mark>, one of the Letters of the Living, who had been directed by his Master to journey throughout India and proclaim to its people the
precepts of His Revelation. <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Sa’íd</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘íd</mark>, in the course of his travels, visited the town of Mooltan, where he met this <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term unknown">Básir</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn605" name="_ftnref605" title="">[********************************]</a> who, <a name="Page_589"></a>though blind, was able to perceive
    immediately, with his inner eye, the significance of the message <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Sa’íd</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘íd</mark> had brought him. The vast learning he had acquired, far from
    hindering him from appreciating the value of the Cause to which he was summoned, enabled him to grasp its meaning and understand the greatness of its
    power. Casting behind him the trappings of leadership, and severing himself from his friends and kinsmen, he arose with a fixed resolve to render his share
    of service to the Cause he had embraced. His first act was to undertake a pilgrimage to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, in the hope of meeting his Beloved. Arriving in that
    city, he was informed, to his surprise and grief, that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had been banished to the mountains of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>, where He was leading a life of
    unrelieved solitude. He straightway proceeded to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, and from thence departed for <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, where he met <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. This meeting relieved his heart from
    the burden of sorrow caused by his failure to meet his Master. To those he subsequently met, of whatever class or creed, he imparted the joys and blessings
    he had so abundantly received from the hands of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, and was able to endow them with a measure of the power with which his intercourse with Him had
    invested his innermost being.
<p></p>I have heard <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>ahíd-i-Mazkán</mark> relate the following: “I was privileged to meet <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term unknown">Básir</mark> at the height of summer during his
    passage through Qamsar, whither the leading men of <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark> go to escape the heat of that town. Day and night, I found him engaged in arguing with the
    leading <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> who had congregated in that village. With ability and insight, he discussed with them the subtleties of their Faith, expounded without fear
    or reservation the fundamental teachings of the Cause, and absolutely confuted their arguments. No one, however great his learning and experience, was able
    to reject the evidences he set forth in support of his claims. Such were his insight and his knowledge <a name="Page_590"></a>of the teachings and
    ordinances of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> that his adversaries conceived him to be a sorcerer, whose baneful influence they feared would ere long rob them of their position.”
<p></p><p>I have similarly heard <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ibráhím</mark>, surnamed <mark class="term unknown">Mullá-Bá<u>sh</u>í</mark>, who was martyred in <mark class="term unknown">Sulṭán-Ábád</mark>, thus recount his impression of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term unknown">Básir</mark>: “Towards
    the end of his life, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term unknown">Básir</mark> passed through <mark class="term unknown">Sulṭán-Ábád</mark>, where I was able to meet him. He was continually associated with the leading <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark>. No one
    could surpass his knowledge of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> and his mastery of the traditions ascribed to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>. He displayed an understanding which made him the terror
    of his adversaries. Often would his opponents question the accuracy of his quotations or reject the existence of the tradition which he produced in support
    of his contention. With unerring exactitude, he would establish the truth of his argument by his reference to the text of the <mark class="term misspelled">Usul-i-Kafi’</mark> <mark class="term correction">Usúl-i-Káfí</mark> and the
    <mark class="term misspelled">‘Biháru’l-Anvar</mark> <mark class="term correction">Biḥáru’l-Anvár</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn606" name="_ftnref606" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> from which he would instantly bring out the
    particular tradition demonstrating the truth of his words. He stood unrivalled alike in the fluency of his argument and the facility with which he brought
    out the most incontrovertible proofs in support of his theme.”
</p><p>From <mark class="term unknown">Sulṭán-Ábád</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term unknown">Básir</mark> proceeded to <mark class="term unknown">Luristán</mark>, where he visited the camp of <mark class="term unknown">Íldírím</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, and was receive by him with marked respect and
    consideration. In the course of his conversation with him one day, the siyyid, who was a man of great courage, referred to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> in terms
    that aroused the fierce anger of <mark class="term unknown">Íldírím</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>. He was furious at the tone and vehemence of his remarks, and ordered that his tongue be pulled out through
    the back of his n eck. The siyyid endured this cruel torture with amazing fortitude, but succumbed to the pain which his oppressor had mercilessly
    inflicted upon him. The same week a letter, in which <mark class="term unknown">Íldírím</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> had abused his brother, <u>Kh</u>anlar <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, was discovered by the latter, who
    immediately obtained the consent of his sovereign to treat him in whatever way he pleased. <u>Kh</u>anlar <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, who entertained an implacable hatred for
    his brother, ordered that he be stripped of his clothes and conducted, naked and in chains, to <mark class="term correct">Ardibíl</mark>, where he was imprisoned and where eventually he
    died. <a name="Page_591"></a><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> spent the entire month of <mark class="term misspelled">Ramadán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ramaḍán</mark> in <mark class="term misspelled">Kirman<u>sh</u>áh</mark> <mark class="term correction">Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh</mark>. <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>ukru’llah-i-Núrí</mark>, one of His kinsmen, and <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term unknown">Muḥammad-i-Mázindarání</mark>, who
    had survived the struggle of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, were the only companions He chose to take with Him to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. I have heard <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> Himself give the reasons for
    His departure from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. “The <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark> <mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, He told us, “asked Us one day to see him. He received Us cordially, and revealed the purpose for which he had
    summoned Us to his presence. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> am well aware,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he gently insinuated, <mark class="term unknown">‘of</mark> the nature and influence of your activities, and am firmly convinced that were it
    not for the support and assistance which you have been extending to <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> and his companions, neither he nor his band of inexperienced students
    would have been capable of resisting for seven months the forces of the imperial government. The ability and skill with which you have managed to direct
    and encourage those efforts could not fail to excite my admiration. I have been unable to obtain any evidence whereby I could establish your complicity in
    this affair. I feel it a pity that so resourceful a person should be left idle and not be given an opportunity to serve his country and sovereign. The
    thought has come to me to suggest to you that you visit <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> in these days when the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> is contemplating a journey to <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark>. It is my
    intention to be enabled, on his return, to confer upon you the position of <mark class="term unknown">Amír-Díván</mark>, a function you could admirably discharge.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> We vehemently protested
    against such accusations, and refused to accept the position he hoped to offer Us. A few days after that interview, We left <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> for <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>.”
</p><p>Ere <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s departure from <mark class="term misspelled">Kirman<u>sh</u>áh</mark> <mark class="term correction">Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh</mark>, He summoned <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> and me to His presence and bade us depart for <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. I was charged to meet
    <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark> immediately after my arrival and to take him with me to the fort of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Dh</u>u’l-Faqar</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Dh</u>u’l-Faqár</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, situated in the vicinity of <u>Sh</u>ahrud,
    and remain with him until <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> returned to the capital <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> was instructed to remain in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> until His arrival, and was entrusted with a
    box of sweetmeats and a letter addressed to <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark>, who was to forward the gift to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, where the Most Great Branch and His mother were
    residing. <a name="Page_592"></a><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark>, to whom I delivered the message, refused to leave <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, and directed me instead to leave for <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>. He compelled me to abide by his wish
    and to take with me certain letters which he bade me deliver to certain of his friends in that town. On my return to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, I was constrained, on the
    insistence of my kinsmen, to leave for <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, however, promised that he would again arrange for my return to the capital, a promise which he
    fulfilled. Two months later, I was again living with him in a caravanserai outside the gate of <mark class="term correct">Naw</mark>, where I passed the whole winter in his company. He
    spent his days in transcribing the Persian <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark> and the “<mark class="term correct">Dalá’il-i-Sab‘ih</mark>,” a work he accomplished with admirable enthusiasm. He entrusted me with two
    copies of the latter, asking me to present them on his behalf to <mark class="term unknown">Mustawfiyu’l-Mamalik-i-A<u>sh</u>tiyání</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term unknown">‘Alíy-i-Tafar<u>sh</u>í</mark>, surnamed
    the <mark class="term unknown">Majdu’l-A<u>sh</u>raf</mark>. The former was so much affected that he was completely won over to the Faith. As for <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, the views he expressed
    were of a totally different character. At a gathering at which <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark> was present, he commented in an unfavourable manner upon the continued
    activities of the believers. “This sect,” he publicly declared, “is still living. Its emissaries are hard at work, spreading the teachings of their leader.
    One of them, a youth, came to visit me the other day, and presented me with a treatise which I regard as highly dangerous. Anyone from among the common
    people who shall read that book will surely be beguiled by its tone.” <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark> immediately understood from his allusions that <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> had sent the
    Book to him and that I had acted as his messenger. On that very day, <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark> asked me to visit him and advised me to return to my home in <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark>. I
    was asked to induce <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> to leave instantly for <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, as both of us, in his opinion, were exposed to great danger. Acting according to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>’s
    instructions, I succeeded in inducing the siyyid to return the Book that had been offered him. Shortly after, I parted company with <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, whom I
never met again. I accompanied him as far as <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>áh-’Abdu’l-’Azim</mark>, while he departed for <mark class="term correct">Qum</mark>, while I pursued my way to <mark class="term correct">Zarand</mark>.    <a name="Page_593"></a>The month of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>avval</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>avvál</mark>, in the year 1267 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn607" name="_ftnref607" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> witnessed the
    arrival of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> at <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. On His way to that holy city, He tarried a few days in <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>, that place which He was soon to visit again and
    where His Cause was destined to mature and unfold itself to the world. When He arrived at <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, He found that a number of its leading residents, among
    whom were <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulṭán</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Javád</mark>, had fallen victims to the pernicious influence of a certain <mark class="term misspelled">Siyyid-i-’Uluvv</mark> <mark class="term correction">Siyyid-i-‘Uluvv</mark>, and had declared
themselves his supporters. They were immersed in superstitions and believed their leader to be the very incarnation of the Divine Spirit. <u>Sh</u>ay    <u>kh</u> <mark class="term correct">Sulṭán</mark> ranked among his most fervent disciples and regarded himself, next to his master, as the foremost leader of his countrymen. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>
    met him on several occasions and succeeded, by His words of counsel and <mark class="term unknown">loving-kindness</mark>, in purging his mind from his idle fancies and in releasing him
    from the state of abject servitude into which he had sunk. He won him over completely to the Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and kindled in his heart a desire to
    propagate the Faith. His <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>, witnessing the effects of his immediate and marvellous conversion, were led, one after another, to forsake their
    former allegiance and to embrace the Cause which their colleague had risen to champion. Abandoned and despised by his former adherents, the <mark class="term misspelled">Siyyid-i-’Uluvv</mark> <mark class="term correction">Siyyid-i-‘Uluvv</mark>
    was at length reduced to recognising the authority of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and acknowledging the superiority of His position. He even went so far as to express
    repentance for his acts, and to pledge his word that he would never again advocate the theories and principles with which he had identified himself.
</p>It was during that visit to <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> that <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> encountered, as He was walking through the streets, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan-i-Zunúzí</mark>, to whom He
    confided the secret He was destined to reveal at a later time in <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>. He found him eagerly searching after the promised <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, to whom the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>
    had so lovingly referred and whom He had promised he would meet in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. We have already, in a preceding chapter, narrated the circumstances leading to
his meeting with <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. From that day, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> became magnetised by the charm of his newly found Master, and    <a name="Page_594"></a>would, but for the restraint he was urged to exercise, have proclaimed to the people of <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> the return of the promised <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
    whose appearance they were awaiting.
<p></p>Among those who were made to feel that power was <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Muḥammad-‘Alíy-i-Tabíb-i-Zanjání</mark>, in whose heart was implanted a seed that was destined to grow and
    blossom into a faith of such tenacity that the fires of persecution were powerless to quench it. To his devotion, his <mark class="term unknown">high-mindedness</mark> and singleness of
purpose <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> Himself testified. That faith carried him eventually to the field of martyrdom. The same fate was shared by <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb-i</mark>-    <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>írází</mark>, son of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Majíd</mark>, who owned a shop in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> and who felt the impulse to forsake all his possessions and follow his Master. He
    was advised, however, not to abandon his work, but to continue to earn his livelihood until such time as he should be summoned to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> urged
    him to be patient, and gave him a sum of money wherewith he encouraged him to extend the scope of his business. Unable to concentrate his attention upon
    his trade, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark> hastened to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, where he remained until he was thrown into the dungeon in which his Master was confined and there
    suffered martyrdom for His sake.

    called and which he served with a selflessness and devotion beyond all praise. To friend and stranger alike he recounted his experiences of the marvellous
    influence the presence of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had had upon him, and enthusiastically described the signs and wonders he had witnessed during and after the days of
    his conversion. <a name="Page_595"></a>CHAPTER XXVI: ATTEMPT ON THE <mark class="term unknown"><u>SH</u>ÁH</mark>’S LIFE, AND ITS CONSEQUENCESTHE eighth <mark class="term correct">Naw-Rúz</mark> after the Declaration of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, which fell on the <mark class="term unknown">twenty-seventh</mark> day of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Jamádiyu’l-Avval</mark><mark class="term correction">Jamádíyu’l-Avval</mark>, in the year 1268 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn608" name="_ftnref608" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> found <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> still in <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, engaged in spreading the teachings,
    and making firm the foundations, of the New Revelation. Displaying an enthusiasm and ability that recalled His activities in the early days of the Movement
    in <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, He continued to devote Himself to the task of reviving the energies, of organising the forces, and of directing the efforts, of the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s scattered companions. He was the sole light amidst the darkness that encompassed the bewildered disciples who had witnessed, on the one hand, the
    cruel martyrdom of their beloved Leader and, on the other, the tragic fate of their companions. He alone was able to inspire them with the needful courage
    and fortitude to endure the many afflictions that had been heaped upon them; He alone was capable of preparing them for the burden of the task they were
    destined to bear, and of inuring them to brave the storm and perils they were soon to face.
<p></p>In the course of the spring of that year, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, who had been guilty of such
infamous outrages against the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> an His companions, met his death in a public bath in <mark class="term unknown">Fín</mark>, near <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn609" name="_ftnref609" title="">[*********************************]</a> having miserably failed to stay the <a name="Page_596"></a>onrush of
    the Faith he had striven so desperately to crush. His own fame and honour were destined eventually to perish with his death, and not the influence of the
    life he had sought to extinguish. During the three years when he held the post of Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> of Persia, his ministry was stained with deeds of blackest
    infamy. What atrocities did not his hands commit as they were stretched forth to tear down the fabric the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had raised! To what treacherous measures did
    he not resort, in his impotent rage, in order to sap the vitality of a Cause which he feared and hated! The first year of his administration was marked by
    the ferocious onslaught of the imperial army of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> against the defenders of the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. With what ruthlessness he conducted
    the campaign of repression against those innocent upholders of the Faith of God! What fury and eloquence he displayed in pleading for the extermination of
    the lives of <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and of three hundred and thirteen of the best and noblest of his countrymen! The second year of his ministry found
    him battling with savage determination to extirpate the Faith in the capital. It was he who authorised and encouraged the capture of the believers who
    resided in that city, and who ordered the execution of the Seven Martyrs of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. It was he who unchained the offensive against <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> and his companions,
    who inspired that campaign of revenge which animated their persecutors, and who instigated them to commit the abominations with which that episode will for
    ever remain associated. That same year witnessed another blow more terrible than any he had hitherto dealt that persecuted community, a blow that brought
    to a tragic end the life of Him who was the Source of all the forces he had in vain sought to repress. The last years of that <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>’s life will for ever
    remain associated with the most revolting of the vast campaigns which his ingenious mind had devised, <a name="Page_597"></a>Illustrations: VILLAGE OF <mark class="term unknown">ÁF<u>CH</u>IH</mark>, NEAR <mark class="term correct">ṬIHRÁN</mark>. THE HOUSE OF <mark class="term correct">BAHÁ’U’LLÁH</mark> IS SEEN THROUGH THE TREES (LEFT REAR); <mark class="term correct">BAHÁ’U’LLÁH</mark>’S HOUSE IN <mark class="term unknown">ÁF<u>CH</u></mark>

    companions. Such were the distinguishing features of a career that began and ended in a reign of terror such as Persia had seldom seen.
<p></p>He was succeeded by <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Núrí</mark>,<a href="#_ftn610" name="_ftnref610" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> who endeavoured, at
    the very outset of his ministry, to effect a reconciliation between the government of which he was the head and <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, whom he regarded as the most
    capable of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s disciples. He sent Him a warm letter requesting Him to return to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, and expressing his eagerness to meet Him. Ere the receipt of
    that letter, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had already decided to leave <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark> for Persia.
<p></p>He arrived in the capital in the month of <mark class="term correct">Rajab</mark>,<a href="#_ftn611" name="_ftnref611" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> and was welcomed by

For one whole month, He was the honoured
    Guest of <a name="Page_599"></a>the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, who had appointed his brother to act as host on his behalf. So great was the number of the notables and
    dignitaries of the capital who flocked to meet Him that He found Himself unable to return to His own home. He remained in that house until His departure
    for <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>imírán</mark>.<a href="#_ftn612" name="_ftnref612" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><p></p>I have heard it stated by <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark> that in the course of that journey <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was able to meet <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark>, who had been endeavouring for a long time to
    see Him, and who in that interview was advised, in the most emphatic terms, to abandon the plan he had conceived. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> condemned his designs,
    dissociated Himself entirely from the act it was his intention to commit, and warned him that such an attempt would precipitate fresh disasters of
    unprecedented magnitude.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> proceeded to <mark class="term unknown">Lavásán</mark>, and was staying in the village of Af<u>ch</u>ih, the property of the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, when the news of the attempt on the
    life of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> reached Him. <mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ja‘far-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was still acting as His host on behalf of the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>. That criminal act was
committed towards the end of the month of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>avval</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>avvál</mark>, in the year 1268 A.H.,    <a href="#_ftn613" name="_ftnref613" title="">[**********************************]</a> by two obscure and irresponsible young men, one named
    <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq-i-Tabrízí</mark>, the other <mark class="term unknown">Fatḥu’lláh-i-Qumí</mark>, both of whom earned their livelihood in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. At a time when the imperial army, headed by the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>
himself, had encamped in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>imírán</mark>, these two ignorant youths, in a frenzy of despair, arose to avenge the blood of their slaughtered brethren.    <a href="#_ftn614" name="_ftnref614" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a><a name="Page_600"></a>The folly that characterised their act was
    betrayed by the fact that in making such an attempt on the life of their sovereign, instead of employing effective weapons which would ensure the success
    of their venture, these youths charged their pistols with shot which no reasonable person would ever think of using for such a purpose. Had their action
    been instigated by a man of judgment and common sense, he would certainly never have allowed them to carry out their intention with such ridiculously
    ineffective instruments.<a href="#_ftn615" name="_ftnref615" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><a name="Page_601"></a>That act, though committed by wild and <mark class="term unknown">feeble-minded</mark> fanatics, and in spite of its being from the very first emphatically condemned by no less responsible
    a person than <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, was the signal for the outbreak of a series of persecutions and massacres of such barbarous ferocity as could be compared only
    to the atrocities of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>. The storm to which that act gave rise plunged the whole of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> into consternation and distress. It involved
    the life of the leading companions who had survived the calamities to which their Faith had been so cruelly and repeatedly subjected. That storm was still
    raging when <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, with some of His ablest lieutenants, was plunged into a filthy, dark, and <mark class="term unknown">fever-stricken</mark> dungeon, whilst chains of such weight as
    only notorious criminals were condemned to carry, were placed upon His neck. For no less than four months He bore the burden, and such was the intensity of
    His suffering that the marks of that cruelty remained imprinted upon His body all the days of His life.
<p></p>So grave a menace to their sovereign and to the institutions of his realm stirred the indignation of the entire body of the ecclesiastical order of Persia.
    To them so bold a deed called for immediate and condign punishment. Measures of unprecedented severity, they clamoured, should be undertaken to stem the
    tide that was engulfing both the government and the Faith of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. Despite the restraint which the followers of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had exercised ever since the
inception of the Faith in every part of the land; despite the repeated charges of the chief disciples to their brethren enjoining them    <a name="Page_602"></a>to refrain from acts of violence, to obey their government loyally, and to disclaim any intention of a holy war, their enemies
    persevered in their deliberate efforts to misrepresent the nature and purpose of that Faith to the authorities. Now that an act of such momentous
    consequences had been committed, what accusations would not these same enemies be prompted to attribute to the Cause with which those guilty of the crime
    had been associated! The moment seemed to have come when they could at last awaken the rulers of the country to the necessity of extirpating as speedily as
    possible a heresy which seemed to threaten the very foundations of the State.
<p></p><mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ja‘far-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who was in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>imírán</mark> when the attempt on the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s life was made, immediately wrote a letter to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> and
    acquainted Him with what had happened. “The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s mother,” he wrote, “is inflamed with anger. She is denouncing you openly before the court and
    people as the <mark class="term unknown">‘would-be</mark><mark class="term unknown">murderer’</mark> of her son. She is also trying to involve <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> in this affair, and accuses him of being your
accomplice.” He urged <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> to remain for a time concealed in that neighbourhood, until the passion of the populace had subsided. He despatched to Af    <u>ch</u>ih an old and experienced messenger whom he ordered to be at the <a name="Page_603"></a>disposal of his Guest and to hold himself in readiness to
    accompany Him to whatever place of safety He might desire.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> refused to avail Himself of the opportunity <mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ja‘far-Qulí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> offered Him. Ignoring the messenger and rejecting his offer, He rode out,
    the next morning, with calm confidence, from <mark class="term unknown">Lavásán</mark>, where He was sojourning, to the headquarters of the imperial army, which was then stationed in
<mark class="term unknown">Níyávarán</mark>, in the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>imírán</mark> district. Arriving at the village of Zarkandih, the seat of the Russian legation, which lay at a distance of one <mark class="term correct">maydán</mark><a href="#_ftn616" name="_ftnref616" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> from <mark class="term unknown">Níyávarán</mark>, He was met by <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Majíd</mark>, His <mark class="term unknown">brother-in-law</mark>, who
    acted as secretary to the Russian minister,<a href="#_ftn617" name="_ftnref617" title="">[***********************************]</a> and was invited by him
    to stay at his home, which adjoined that of his superior. The attendants of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the <mark class="term unknown">Ḥajíbu’d-Dawlih</mark>, recognised Him and went straightway
    to inform their master, who in turn brought the matter to the attention of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>.
<p></p>The news of the arrival of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> greatly surprised the officers of the imperial army. <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> himself was amazed at the bold and
    unexpected step which a man who was accused of being the chief instigator of the attempt upon his life had taken. He immediately sent one of his trusted
    officers to the legation, demanding that the Accused be delivered into his hands. The Russian minister refused, and requested <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> to proceed to the
    home of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, a place he thought to be the most appropriate under the circumstances. His request was granted, whereupon
    the minister formally communicated to the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> his desire that the utmost care should be exercised to ensure the safety and protection of the Trust
his government was delivering into his keeping, warning him that he would hold him responsible should he fail to disregard his wishes.    <a href="#_ftn618" name="_ftnref618" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a><p></p><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, though he undertook to give the fullest assurances that were required, and received <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> with every mark of respect into his
    home, was, however, too apprehensive <a name="Page_604"></a>for the safety of his own position to accord his Guest the treatment he was expected to extend.
<p></p>As <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was leaving the village of Zarkandih, the minister’s daughter, who felt greatly distressed at the dangers which beset His life, was so
    overcome with emotion that she was unable to restrain her tears. “Of what use,” she was heard expostulating with her father, “is the authority with which
    you have been invested, if you are powerless to extend your protection to a guest whom you have received in your house?” The minister, who had a great
    affection for his daughter, was moved by the sight of her tears, and sought to comfort her by his assurances that he would do all in his power to avert the
    danger that threatened the life of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>.
<p></p>That day the army of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> was thrown into a state of violent tumult. The peremptory orders of the sovereign, following so closely upon
    the attempt on his life, gave rise to the wildest rumours and excited the fiercest passions in the hearts of the people of the, neighbourhood. The
    agitation spread to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and fanned into flaming fury the smouldering embers of hatred which the enemies of the Cause still nourished ill their hearts.
Confusion, unprecedented in its range, reigned in the capital. A word of denunciation, a sign, or a whisper was sufficient to subject the    <a name="Page_605"></a>innocent to a persecution which no pen dare try to describe. Security of life and property had completely vanished. The highest
    ecclesiastical authorities in the capital joined hands with the most influential members of the government to deal what they hoped would be the fatal blow
to a foe who, for eight years, had so gravely shaken the peace of the land, and whom no cunning or violence had yet been able to silence.    <a href="#_ftn619" name="_ftnref619" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a><a name="Page_606"></a><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, now that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was no more, appeared in their eyes to be the <mark class="term unknown">arch-foe</mark> whom they deemed it their first duty to seize and imprison. To them He
    was the reincarnation of the Spirit the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had so powerfully manifested, the Spirit through which He had been able to accomplish so complete a
    transformation in the lives and habits of His countrymen. The precautions the Russian minister had taken, and the warning he had uttered, failed to stay
    the hand that had been outstretched with such determination against that precious Life.
<p></p>From <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>imírán</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was several times <a name="Page_607"></a>stripped of His garments, and was overwhelmed with abuse and ridicule.
    On foot and exposed to the fierce rays of the midsummer sun, He was compelled to cover, barefooted and bareheaded, the whole distance from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>imírán</mark>
    to the dungeon already referred to. All along the route, He was pelted and vilified by the crowds whom His enemies had succeeded in convincing that He was
    the sworn enemy of their sovereign and the wrecker of his realm. Words fail me to portray the horror of the treatment which was meted out to Him as He was
    being taken to the <mark class="term correct">Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál</mark><a href="#_ftn620" name="_ftnref620" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. As He was
    approaching the dungeon, and old and decrepit woman was seen to emerge from the midst of the crowd, with a stone in her hand, eager to cast it at the face
    of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. Her eyes glowed with a determination and fanaticism of which few women of her age were capable. Her whole frame shook with rage as she
stepped forward and raised her hand to hurl her missile at Him. “By the <mark class="term misspelled">Siyyidu’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>uhada</mark><mark class="term correction">Siyyidu’<u>sh</u>-<u>Sh</u>uhadá’</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn621" name="_ftnref621" title="">[************************************]</a> I adjure you,” she pleaded, as she ran to overtake those into
    whose hands <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had been delivered, “give me a chance to fling my stone in his face!” “Suffer not this woman to be <a name="Page_608"></a>disappointed,” were <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s words to His guards, as He saw her hastening behind Him. “Deny her not what she regards as a meritorious act in the sight
    of God.”
<p></p><p>The <mark class="term correct">Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál</mark>, into which <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was thrown, originally a reservoir of water for one of the public baths of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, was a subterranean dungeon
    in which criminals of the worst type were wont to be confined. The darkness, the filth, and the character of the prisoners, combined to make of that
    pestilential dungeon the most abominable place to which human beings could be condemned. His feet were placed in stocks, and around His neck were fastened
the <mark class="term unknown">Qará-Guhar</mark> chains, infamous throughout Persia for their galling weight.    <a href="#_ftn622" name="_ftnref622" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> For three days and three nights, no manner of food or drink was
    given to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. Rest and sleep were both impossible to Him. The place was infested with vermin, and the stench of that gloomy abode was enough to
    crush the very spirits of those who were condemned to suffer its horrors. Such were the conditions under which He was held down that even one of the
    executioners who were watching over Him was moved with pity. Several times this man attempted to induce Him to take some tea which he had managed to
introduce into the dungeon under the cover of his garments. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, however, would refuse to drink it. His family often endeavoured to persuade the    <a name="Page_609"></a>guards to allow them to carry the food they had prepared for Him into His prison. Though at first no amount of pleading would induce
    the guards to relax the severity of their discipline, yet gradually they yielded to His <mark class="term unknown">friends’</mark> importunity. No one could be sure, however, whether that
    food would eventually reach Him, or whether He would consent to eat it whilst a number of His <mark class="term unknown">fellow-prisoners</mark> were starving before His eyes. Surely
greater misery than had befallen these innocent victims of the wrath of their sovereign, could hardly be imagined.    <a href="#_ftn623" name="_ftnref623" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a>
</p>As to the youth <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq-i-Tabrízí</mark>, the fate he suffered was as cruel as it was humiliating. He was seized at the moment he was rushing towards the <u>Sh</u><mark class="term unknown">áh</mark>, whom he had thrown from his horse, hoping to strike him with the sword he held in his hand. The <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>atír-Bá<u>sh</u>í</mark>, together with the
    <mark class="term unknown">Mustawfíyu’l-Mámalík</mark>’s attendants, fell upon him and, without attempting to learn who he was, slew him on the spot. Wishing to allay the excitement of the
populace, they hewed his body into two halves, each of which they suspended to the public <a name="Page_610"></a>gaze at the entrance of the gates of    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>imírán</mark> and <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>áh-’Abdu’l-’Azim</mark>.<a href="#_ftn624" name="_ftnref624" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> His two other
    companions, <mark class="term unknown">Fatḥu’llah-i-Hakkak-i-Qumí</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term unknown">Qásim-i-Nayrízí</mark>, who had succeeded in inflicting only slight wounds on the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, were subjected to
    inhuman treatment, to which they ultimately owed their death. <mark class="term misspelled">Fatḥu’llah</mark><mark class="term correction">Fatḥu’lláh</mark>, though suffering unspeakable cruelties, obstinately refused to answer the
    questions they asked him. The silence he maintained in the face of manifold tortures, induced his persecutors to believe that he was devoid of the power of
    speech. Exasperated by the failure of their efforts, they poured molten lead down his throat, an act which brought his sufferings to an end.
<p></p>His comrade, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Qásim</mark>, was treated with a savagery still more revolting. On the very day <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was being subjected to that terrible
ordeal, this poor wretch was receiving similar treatment at the hands of his persecutors in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>imírán</mark>. He was stripped of his clothes, lighted    <a name="Page_611"></a>candles were thrust into holes driven into his flesh, and he was thus paraded before the eyes of a multitude who yelled and cursed
    him. The spirit of revenge that animated those into whose hands he was delivered seemed insatiable. Day after day fresh victims were forced to expiate with
    their blood a crime which they had never committed, and of the circumstances of which they were wholly ignorant. Every ingenious device that the
    <mark class="term unknown">torture-mongers</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> could employ was applied with merciless severity to the bodies of these unfortunate ones who were neither brought to trial nor
    questioned, and whose right to plead and prove their innocence was entirely ignored.
<p></p>Each of those days of terror witnessed the martyrdom of two companions of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, one of whom was slain in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, whilst the other met his fate in    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>imírán</mark>. Both were subjected to the same manner of torture, both were handed over to the public to wreak their vengeance upon them. Those arrested
were distributed among the various classes of people, whose messengers would visit the dungeon each day and claim their <a name="Page_612"></a>victim.    <a href="#_ftn625" name="_ftnref625" title="">[*************************************]</a> Conducting him to the scene of his death, they would give the
    signal for a general attack upon him, whereupon men and women would close upon their prey, tear his body to pieces, and so mutilate it that no trace of its
    original form would remain. Such ruthlessness amazed even the most brutal of the executioners, whose hands, however much accustomed to human slaughter, had
never perpetrated the atrocities of which those people had proved themselves capable.    <a href="#_ftn626" name="_ftnref626" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a><a name="Page_613"></a>Of all the tortures which an insatiable enemy inflicted upon its victims, none was more revolting in its character than that which characterised the death
    of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. He was the son of <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, one of the officers in the service of the <mark class="term misspelled">Nayibu’s-Saltanih</mark><mark class="term correction">Náyibu’s-Salṭanih</mark>, who was the father of
    <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>. He retained that same position in the early days of the reign of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> showed from his
    earliest years a marked disinclination to rank and office. Ever since the day of his acceptance of <a name="Page_614"></a>the Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, the petty
    pursuits in which the people around him were immersed excited his pity and contempt. The vanity of their ambitions had been abundantly demonstrated in his
    eyes. In his early youth, he felt a longing to escape from the turmoil of the capital and to seek refuge in the holy city of <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. There he met <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> and grew to be one of his most ardent supporters. His sincere piety, his frugality and love of seclusion were among the chief traits of his
    character. He tarried in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> until the day when the Call from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> reached him through <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Yúsúf-i-Ardibílí</mark><mark class="term correction">Yúsuf-i-Ardibílí</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Mihdíy-Kú’í</mark>, both of
whom were among his <mark class="term unknown">best-known</mark> friends. He enthusiastically embraced the Message of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>.    <a href="#_ftn627" name="_ftnref627" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> He had intended, upon his return from <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, to join
    the defenders of the fort of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, but arrived too late to achieve his purpose. He remained in the capital and continued to wear the kind of dress he
had adopted in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. The small turban he wore, and the white tunic which his black <mark class="term correct">‘abá</mark><a href="#_ftn628" name="_ftnref628" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> concealed, were displeasing to the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, who induced him to
discard these garments and to clothe himself instead in a <a name="Page_615"></a>military uniform. He was made to wear the <mark class="term correct">kuláh</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn629" name="_ftnref629" title="">[**************************************]</a> a <mark class="term unknown">head-dress</mark> that was thought to be more in accordance with the
    rank his father held. Though the <mark class="term correct">Amír</mark> insisted that he should accept a position in the service of the government, he obstinately refused to comply with his
    request. Most of his time was spent in the company of the disciples of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, particularly those of His companions who had survived the struggle of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>. He surrounded them with a care and kindness truly surprising. He and his father were so influential that the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark> was induced to spare his
    life and indeed to refrain from any acts of violence against him. Though he was present in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> when the seven companions of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, with whom he was
    intimately associated, were martyred, neither the officials of the government nor any of the common people ventured to demand his arrest. Even in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>,
    whither he had journeyed for the purpose of saving the life of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, not one among the inhabitants of that city dared to lift a finger against him. The
    <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, who was duly informed of all his services to the Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, preferred to ignore his acts rather than precipitate a conflict with him and
    his father.
<p></p>Soon after the martyrdom of a certain <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Zaynu’l-’Abidin-i-Yazdí</mark>, a rumour was spread that those whom the government intended to put to death, among
    whom were <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s amanuensis, and <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>, were to be released and that further persecution of their friends was to be definitely
    abandoned. It was reported far and wide that the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark><mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark>, deeming the hour of his death to be approaching, had been seized suddenly with a great fear
    and, in an agony of repentance, had exclaimed: “I am haunted by the vision of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>, whom I have caused to be martyred. I can now see the
    fearful mistake I have made. I should have restrained the violence of those who pressed me to shed his blood and that of his companions. I now perceive
    that the interests of the State required it.” His successor, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, was similarly inclined in the early days of his administration, and was
    intending to inaugurate his ministry with a lasting reconciliation between him and the followers of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. He was preparing to <a name="Page_616"></a>undertake that task when the attempt on the life of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> shattered his plans and threw the capital into a state of unprecedented confusion.
<p></p>I have heard the Most Great Branch,<a href="#_ftn630" name="_ftnref630" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> who in those days was a child
    of only eight years of age, recount one of His experiences as He ventured to leave the house in which He was then residing. “We had sought shelter, He told
    us, “in the house of My uncle, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Ismá’íl</mark><mark class="term correction">Ismá‘íl</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> was in the throes of the wildest excitement. I ventured at times to sally forth from that house and to
    cross the street on My way to the market. I would hardly cross the threshold and step into the street, when boys of My age, who were running about, would
    crowd around Me crying, <mark class="term misspelled">‘Babi</mark><mark class="term correction">Bábí</mark>! <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>. Knowing well the state of excitement into which all the inhabitants of the capital, both young and old, had fallen, I
    would deliberately ignore their clamour and quietly steal away to My home. One day I happened to be walking alone through the market on My way to My
    uncle’s house. As I was looking behind Me, I found a band of little ruffians running fast to overtake Me. They were pelting Me with stones and shouting
    menacingly, <mark class="term misspelled">‘Babi</mark><mark class="term correction">Bábí</mark>! <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> To intimidate them seemed to be the only way I could avert the danger with which I was threatened. I turned back and rushed
    towards them with such determination that they fled away in distress and vanished. I could hear their distant cry, <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> little <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> is fast pursuing us! He
    will surely overtake and slay us all!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> As I was directing My steps towards home, I heard a man shouting at the top of his voice: <mark class="term unknown">‘Well</mark> done, you brave and
    fearless child! No one of your age would ever have been able, unaided, to withstand their attack.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> From that day onward, I was never again molested by any
    of the boys of the streets, nor did I hear any offensive word fall from their lips.”
<p></p><p>Among those who, in the midst of the general confusion, were seized and thrown into prison was <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the circumstances of whose
    martyrdom I now proceed to relate. The facts I mention have been carefully sifted and verified by me, and I owe them, for the most part, to <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark>,
    who was himself in those days in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and was made <a name="Page_617"></a>to share the terrors and sufferings of his brethren. “On the very day of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>’s martyrdom,” he informed me, “I happened to be present, with <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Majíd</mark>, at a gathering in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> at which a considerable
    number of the notables and dignitaries of the capital were present. Among them was <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Maḥmúd</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Nizámu’l-‘Ulamá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Niẓámu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>, who requested the <mark class="term correct">Kalantar</mark> to
describe the actual circumstances of the death of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. The <mark class="term correct">Kalantar</mark> motioned with his finger to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">kad-<u>kh</u>udá</mark>    <a href="#_ftn631" name="_ftnref631" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> who, he said, had conducted the victim from the vicinity of the
    imperial palace to the place of his execution, outside the gate of <mark class="term correct">Naw</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> was accordingly requested to relate to those present all that he had
    seen and heard. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> and my assistants,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he said, <mark class="term unknown">‘were</mark> ordered to purchase nine candles and to thrust them, ourselves into deep holes we were to cut in his
    flesh. We were instructed to light each one of these candles and to conduct him through the market to the accompaniment of drums and trumpets as far as the
    place of his execution. There we were ordered to hew his body into two halves, each of which we were asked to suspend on either side of the gate of <mark class="term correct">Naw</mark>. He
himself chose the manner in which he wished to be martyred. <mark class="term unknown">Ḥajíbu’d-Dawlih</mark>    <a href="#_ftn632" name="_ftnref632" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> had been commanded by <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> to enquire into
    the complicity of the accused, and, if assured of his innocence, to induce him to recant. If he submitted, his life was to be spared and he was to be
    detained pending the final settlement of his case. In the event of his refusal, he was to be put to death in whatever manner he himself might desire.
</p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> investigation of <mark class="term unknown">hajibu’d-Dawlih</mark> convinced him of the innocence of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. The accused, as soon as he had been informed of the
    instructions of his sovereign, was heard joyously exclaiming: “Never, so long as my <mark class="term unknown">life-blood</mark> continues to pulsate in my veins, shall I be willing to
recant my faith in my Beloved! This world which the Commander of the Faithful    <a href="#_ftn633" name="_ftnref633" title="">[***************************************]</a> has likened to carrion will never allure me from my heart’s
    Desire.” He was asked to <a name="Page_618"></a>determine the manner in which he wished to die. “Pierce holes in my flesh,” was the instant reply, “and in
    each wound place a candle. Let nine candles be lighted all over my body, and in this state conduct me through the streets of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. Summon the multitude
    to witness the glory of my martyrdom, so that the memory of my death may remain imprinted in their hearts and help them, as they recall the intensity of my
    tribulation, to recognise the Light I have embraced. After I have reached the foot of the gallows and have uttered the last prayer of my earthly life,
    cleave my body in twain and suspend my limbs on either side of the gate of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, that the multitude passing beneath it may witness to the love which the
    Faith of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> has kindled in the hearts of His disciples, and may look upon the proofs of their devotion.”
<p></p><p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘Ḥajíbu’d-Dawlih</mark> instructed his men to abide by the expressed wishes of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, and charged me to conduct him through the market as far
    as the place of his execution. As they handed to the victim the candles they had purchased, and were preparing to thrust their knives into his breast, he
    made a sudden attempt to seize the weapon from the executioner’s trembling hands in order to plunge it himself into his flesh. “Why fear and hesitate?” he
    cried, as he stretched forth his arm to snatch the knife from his grasp. “Let me myself perform the deed and light the candles.” Fearing lest he should
    attack us, I ordered my men to resist his attempt and bade them tie his hands behind his back. “Let me,” he pleaded, point out with my fingers the places
    into which I wish them to thrust their dagger, for I have no other request to make besides this.”
</p><p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘He</mark> asked them to pierce two holes in his breast, two in his shoulders, one in the nape of his neck, and the four others in his back. With stoic calm he
    endured those tortures. Steadfastness glowed in his eyes as he maintained a mysterious and unbroken silence. Neither the howling of the multitude nor the
    sight of the blood that streamed all over his body could induce him to interrupt that silence. Impassive and serene he remained until all the nine candles
    were placed in position and lighted.
</p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘When</mark> all was completed for his march to the scene <a name="Page_619"></a>of his death, he, standing erect as an arrow and with that same unflinching
    fortitude gleaming upon his face, stepped forward to lead the concourse that was pressing round him to the place that was to witness the consummation of
    his martyrdom. Every few steps he would interrupt his march and, gazing at the bewildered bystanders, would shout: “What greater pomp and pageantry than
    those which this day accompany my progress to win the crown of glory! Glorified be the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, who can kindle such devotion in the breasts of His lovers, and
    can endow them with a power greater than the might of kings!” At times, as if intoxicated with the fervour of that devotion, he would exclaim: “The Abraham
    of a bygone age, as He prayed God, in the hour of bitter agony, to send down upon Him the refreshment for which His soul was crying, heard the voice of the
Unseen proclaim: <mark class="term unknown">‘O</mark> fire! Be thou cold, and to Abraham a safety!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn634" name="_ftnref634" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> But this <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark> is crying out from the depths of his ravaged
    heart: <mark class="term unknown">‘Lord</mark>, Lord, let Thy fire burn unceasingly within me, and suffer its flame to consume my being.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” As his eyes saw the wax flicker in his wounds, he
    burst forth in an acclamation of frantic delight: “Would that He whose hand has enkindled my soul were here to behold my state!” “Think me not to be
    intoxicated with the wine of this earth!” he cried to the vast throng who stood aghast at the sight of his behaviour. It is the love of my Beloved that has
    filled my soul and made me feel endowed with a sovereignty which even kings might envy!”
<p></p><p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> cannot recall the exclamations of joy which fell from his lips as he drew near to his end. All I remember are but a few of the stirring words which, in
    his moments of exultation, he was moved to cry out to the concourse of spectators. Words fail me to portray the expression of that countenance or to
    measure the effect of his words on the multitude.
</p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘He</mark> was still in the bazaar when the blowing of a breeze excited the burning of the candles that were placed upon his breast. As they melted rapidly,
    their flames reached the level of the wounds into which they had been thrust. We who were following a few steps behind him could hear distinctly the
    sizzling of his flesh. The sight of gore and fire <a name="Page_620"></a>which covered his body, instead of silencing his voice, appeared to heighten his
    unquenchable enthusiasm. He could still be heard, this time addressing the flames, as they ate into his wounds: “You have long lost your sting, O flames,
    and have been robbed of your power to pain me. Make haste, for from your very tongues of fire I can hear the voice that calls me to my Beloved!”
<p></p><p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘Pain</mark> and suffering seemed to have melted away in the ardour of that enthusiasm. Enveloped by the flames, he walked as a conqueror might have marched to
    the scene of his victory. He moved through the excited crowd a blaze of light amidst the gloom that surrounded him. Arriving at the foot of the gallows, he
    again raised his voice in a last appeal to the multitude of onlookers: “Did not this <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark> whom you now see before you a prey to fire and blood, enjoy
    until recently all the favours and riches the world can bestow? What could have caused him to renounce this earthly glory and accept in return such great
    degradation and suffering?” Prostrating himself in the direction of the shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám-Zádih</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, he murmured certain words in Arabic which I could
    not understand. “My work is now finished!” he cried to the executioner, as soon as his prayer was ended. “Come and do yours!” He was still alive when his
    body was hewn into two halves with a hatchet. The praise of his Beloved, despite such incredible sufferings, lingered upon his lips until the last moment
    of his life.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><a href="#_ftn635" name="_ftnref635" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a>
</p>“That tragic tale stirred the listeners to the very depths of their souls. The <mark class="term misspelled">Nizámu’l-‘Ulamá</mark><mark class="term correction">Niẓámu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>, who was listening intently <a name="Page_621"></a>to all
    its details, wrung his hands in horror and despair. How strange, how very strange, is this Cause!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he exclaimed. Without adding a further word of comment,
    he, immediately after, arose and departed.”<a href="#_ftn636" name="_ftnref636" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a><p></p>Those days of unceasing turmoil witnessed the martyrdom of yet another eminent disciple of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. A woman, no less great and heroic than <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> herself,
    was engulfed in the storm that was then raging with undiminished violence throughout the capital. What I now begin to relate regarding the circumstances of
    her martyrdom has been obtained from trustworthy informants, some of whom were themselves witnesses of the events I am attempting to describe. Her stay in
    <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> was marked by many proofs of the warm <a name="Page_622"></a>affection and high esteem in which she was held by the leading women of the capital.
She had reached, indeed, in those days, the <mark class="term unknown">high-water</mark> mark of her popularity.    <a href="#_ftn637" name="_ftnref637" title="">[****************************************]</a> The house where she was confined was besieged by her women
admirers, who thronged her doors, eager to enter her presence and to seek the benefit of her knowledge.<a href="#_ftn638" name="_ftnref638" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a> Among these ladies, the wife of <mark class="term misspelled">Kalántar</mark><mark class="term correction">Kalantar</mark><a href="#_ftn639" name="_ftnref639" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> distinguished herself by the extreme reverence she showed to
    <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>. Acting as her hostess, she introduced into her presence the flower of womanhood in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, served her with extraordinary enthusiasm, and never
    failed to contribute her share in deepening her influence among her womenfolk. Persons with whom the wife of <mark class="term misspelled">Kalántar</mark><mark class="term correction">Kalantar</mark> was intimately connected have heard
    her relate the following: “One night, whilst <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> was staying in my home, I was summoned to her presence and found her fully adorned, dressed in a gown
    of <mark class="term unknown">snow-white</mark> silk. Her room was redolent with the choicest perfume. I expressed to her my surprise at so unusual a sight. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> am preparing to meet my
    Beloved,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> she said, <mark class="term unknown">‘and</mark> wish to free you from the cares <a name="Page_623"></a>and anxieties of my imprisonment.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I was much startled at first, and wept
    at the thought of separation from her. <mark class="term unknown">‘Weep</mark> not, she sought to reassure me. <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> time of your lamentation is not yet come. I wish to share with you my
    last wishes, for the hour when I shall be arrested and condemned to suffer martyrdom is fast approaching. I would request you to allow your son to
    accompany me to the scene of my death and to ensure that the guards and executioner into whose hands I shall be delivered will not compel me to divest
    myself of this attire. It is also my wish that my body be thrown into a pit, and that that pit be filled with earth and stones. Three days after my death a
    woman will come and visit you, to whom you will give this package which I now deliver into your hands. My last request is that you permit no one henceforth
    to enter my chamber. From now until the time when I shall be summoned to leave this house, let no one be allowed to disturb my devotions. This day I intend
    to fast—a fast which I shall not break until I am brought face to face <a name="Page_624"></a>with my Beloved.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> She bade me, with these words, lock the
    door of her chamber and not open it until the hour of her departure should strike. She also urged me to keep secret the tidings of her death until such
    time as her enemies should themselves disclose it.
<p></p>“The great love I cherished for her in my heart, alone enabled me to abide by her instructions. But for the compelling desire I felt to fulfil her wishes,
    I would never have consented to deprive myself of one moment of her presence. I locked the door of her chamber and retired to my own, in a state of
    uncontrollable sorrow. I lay sleepless and disconsolate upon my bed. The thought of her approaching martyrdom lacerated my soul. <mark class="term unknown">‘Lord</mark>, Lord,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I prayed in
    my despair, <mark class="term unknown">‘turn</mark> from her, if it be Thy wish, the cup which her lips desire to drink.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> That day and night, I several times, unable to contain myself,
    arose and stole away to the threshold of that room and stood silently at her door, eager to listen to whatever might be falling from her lips. I was
    enchanted by the melody of that voice which intoned the praise of her Beloved. I could hardly remain standing upon my feet, so <a name="Page_625"></a>great
    was my agitation. Four hours after sunset, I heard a knocking at the door. I hastened immediately to my son, and acquainted him with the wishes of <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>.
    He pledged his word that he would fulfil every instruction she had given me. It chanced that night that my husband was absent. My son, who opened the door,
    informed me that the <mark class="term unknown">farrá<u>sh</u>es</mark><a href="#_ftn640" name="_ftnref640" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> of <mark class="term misspelled">Azíz</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Azíz</mark><u>Kh</u><mark class="term unknown">án-i-Sardár</mark> were standing at the gate, demanding that <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> be immediately delivered into their hands. I was struck with terror by the news, and, as I
    tottered to her door and with trembling hands unlocked it, found her veiled and prepared to leave her apartment. She was pacing the floor when I entered,
    and was chanting a litany expressive of both grief and triumph. As soon as she saw me, she approached and kissed me. She placed in my hand the key to her
    chest, in which she said she had left for me a few trivial things as a remembrance of her stay in my house. Whenever you open this chest,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> she said, <mark class="term unknown">‘and</mark>
    behold the things it contains, you will, I hope, remember me and rejoice in my gladness.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“With these words she bade me her last farewell, and, accompanied by my son, disappeared from before my eyes. What pangs of anguish I felt that moment, as
    I beheld her beauteous form gradually fade away in the distance! She mounted the steed which the <mark class="term unknown">Sardár</mark> had sent for her, and, escorted by my son and a
    number of attendants, who marched on each side of her, rode out to the garden that was to be the scene of her martyrdom.
</p>“Three hours later my son returned, his face drenched with tears, hurling imprecations at the <mark class="term unknown">Sardár</mark> and his abject lieutenants. I tried to calm his
    agitation, and, seating him beside me, asked him to relate as fully as he could the circumstances of her death. <mark class="term unknown">‘Mother</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he sobbingly replied, <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> can
scarcely attempt to describe what my eyes have beheld. We straightway proceeded to the <mark class="term correct">Íl<u>kh</u>ání</mark> garden,    <a href="#_ftn641" name="_ftnref641" title="">[*]</a><a name="Page_626"></a>outside the gate of the city. There I found, to my horror, the <mark class="term unknown">Sardár</mark> and his
    lieutenants absorbed in acts of debauchery and shame, flushed with wine and roaring with laughter. Arriving at the gate, <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> dismounted and, calling me
    to her, asked me to act as her intermediary with the <mark class="term unknown">Sardár</mark>, whom she said she was disinclined to address in the midst of his revelry. <mark class="term unknown">‘They</mark> apparently
    wish to strangle me,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> she said. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> set aside, long ago, a silken kerchief which I hoped would be used for this purpose. I deliver it into your hands and
    wish you to induce that dissolute drunkard to use it as a means whereby he can take my life.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“When I went to the <mark class="term unknown">Sardár</mark>, I found him in a state of wretched intoxication. <mark class="term unknown">‘Interrupt</mark> not the gaiety of our festival!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I heard him shout as I approached
    him. <mark class="term unknown">‘Let</mark> that miserable wretch be strangled and her body be thrown into a pit!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> I was greatly surprised at such an order. Believing it unnecessary to
    venture any request from him, I went to two of his attendants, with whom I was already acquainted, and gave them the kerchief with which <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> had
    entrusted me. They consented to grant her request. That same kerchief was wound round her neck and was made the instrument of her martyrdom. I hastened
    immediately afterwards to the gardener and asked him whether <a name="Page_627"></a>he could suggest a place where I could conceal the body. He directed
    me, to my great delight, to a well that had been dug recently and left unfinished. With the help of a few others, I lowered her into her grave and filled
    the well with earth and stones in the manner she herself had wished. Those who saw her in her last moments were profoundly affected. With downcast eyes and
    rapt in silence, they mournfully dispersed, leaving their victim, who had shed so imperishable a lustre upon their country, buried beneath a mass of stones
    which they, with their own hands, had heaped upon her.
</p>I wept hot tears as my son unfolded to my eyes that tragic tale. I was so overcome with emotion that I fell prostrate and unconscious upon the ground. When
    I had recovered, I found my son a prey to an agony no less severe than my own. He lay upon his couch, weeping in a passion of devotion. Beholding my
    plight, he approached and comforted me. <mark class="term unknown">‘Your</mark> tears,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he said, <mark class="term unknown">‘will</mark> betray you in the eyes of my father. Considerations of rank and position will, no
doubt, induce him to forsake us and sever whatever ties bind him to this home. He will, if we fail to repress our tears, accuse us before <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, as victims of the charm of a hateful enemy. He will obtain the sovereign’s consent to our death, and will probably, with his own hands,
    proceed to slay us. Why should we, who have never embraced that Cause, allow ourselves to suffer such a fate at his hands? All we should do is to defend
    her against those who denounce her as the very negation of chastity and honour. We should ever treasure her love in our hearts and maintain in the face of
    a slanderous enemy the integrity of that life.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“His words allayed my inner agitation. I went to her chest and, with the key she had placed in my hand, opened it. I found a small vial of the choicest
    perfume, beside which lay a rosary, a coral necklace, and three rings, mounted with turquoise, cornelian, and ruby stones. As I gazed upon her earthly
    belongings, I mused over the circumstances of her eventful life, and recalled, with a throb of wonder, her intrepid courage, her zeal, her high sense of
    duty and unquestioning devotion. I was reminded of her literary attainments, and brooded over the imprisonments, the shame, and the calumny which she had
    faced with a fortitude such as no other woman <a name="Page_628"></a>in her land could manifest. I pictured to myself that winsome face which now, alas,
    lay buried beneath a mass of earth and stones. The memory of her passionate eloquence warmed my heart, as I repeated to myself the words that had so often
    dropped from her lips. The consciousness of the vastness of her knowledge, and her mastery of the sacred Scriptures of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, flashed through my mind with
    a suddenness that disconcerted me. Above all, her passionate loyalty to the Faith she had embraced, her fervour as she pleaded its cause, the services she
    rendered it, the woes and tribulations she endured for its sake, the example she had given to its followers, the impetus she had lent to its advancement
    the name she had carved for herself in the hearts of her <mark class="term unknown">fellow-countrymen</mark>, all these I remembered as I stood beside her chest, wondering what could have
    induced so great a woman to forsake all the riches and honours with which she had been surrounded and to identify herself with the cause of an obscure
    youth from <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. What could have been the secret, I thought to myself, of the power that tore her away from her home and kindred, that sustained
    her throughout her stormy career, and eventually carried her to her grave? Could that force, I pondered, be of God? Could the hand of the Almighty have
    guided her destiny and steered her course amidst the perils of her life?
</p>“On the third day after her martyrdom,<a href="#_ftn642" name="_ftnref642" title="">[†]</a> the woman whose coming she had promised arrived. I enquired her
    name, and, finding it to be the same as the one <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> had told me, delivered into her hands the package with which I had been entrusted. I had never
    before met that woman, nor did I ever see her again.”<a href="#_ftn643" name="_ftnref643" title="">[‡]</a><p></p>The name of that immortal woman was <mark class="term misspelled">Fátimih</mark><mark class="term correction">Fáṭimih</mark>, a name which her father had bestowed upon her. She was surnamed <mark class="term unknown">Umm-i-Salmih</mark> by her family and kindred, who
    also designated her as <mark class="term unknown">Zakíyyih</mark>. She was born in the year 1233 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn644" name="_ftnref644" title="">[§]</a> the very year which witnessed the
birth of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. She was <mark class="term unknown">thirty-six</mark> years of age when she suffered martyrdom in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. May future generations be enabled to present a    <a name="Page_629"></a>worthy account of a life which her contemporaries have failed adequately to recognise. May future historians perceive the full
    measure of her influence, and record the unique services this great woman has rendered to her land and its people. May the followers of the Faith which she
    served so well strive to follow her example, recount her deeds, collect her writings, unfold the secret of her talents, and establish her, for all time, in
    the memory and affections of the peoples and kindreds of the earth.<a href="#_ftn645" name="_ftnref645" title="">[**]</a>Another distinguished figure among the disciples of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> who met his death during the turbulent time that had overwhelmed <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> was <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Yazdí</mark>, who was the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s amanuensis both in <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark> and <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark>. Such was his knowledge of the teachings of the Faith that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, in a
    Tablet addressed to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark>, urged the latter to seek enlightenment from him in whatever might pertain to the sacred writings. A man of standing and
    experience, in whom the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> reposed the utmost confidence and with whom he had been intimately associated, he suffered, after the martyrdom of his Master
in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, the agony of a long confinement in the subterranean dungeon of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, which confinement terminated in his martyrdom. To a very great    <a name="Page_630"></a>extent, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> helped to allay the hardships from which he suffered. Regularly every month He sent him whatever financial
    assistance he required. He was praised and admired even by the gaolers who watched over him. His long and intimate companionship with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, during the
    last and stormiest days of His life, had deepened his understanding and endowed his soul with a power which he was destined to manifest more and more as
    the days of his earthly life drew near to their close. He lay in the prison, longing for the time when he should be called upon to suffer a death similar
    to that of his Master. Deprived of the privilege of being martyred on the same day as the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, a privilege which it had been his supreme desire to attain,
    he now eagerly awaited the hour when he, in his turn, should drain to the very dregs the cup that had touched His lips. Many a time did the leading
    officials of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> strive to induce him to accept their offer to deliver him from the rigours of his imprisonment, as well as from the prospect of a still
    more cruel death. He steadfastly refused. Tears flowed unceasingly from his eyes—tears born of his longing to see again that face whose radiance had shone
    so brightly amidst the darkness of a cruel incarceration in <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>, and whose glow warmed the chill <a name="Page_631"></a>of its wintry
    nights. As he mused in the gloom of his prison cell over those blissful days spent in the presence of his Master, there came to him One who alone could
    banish, by the light of His presence, the anguish that had settled upon his soul. His Comforter was none other than <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> Himself. In His company
    <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was privileged to remain until the hour of his death. The hand of <mark class="term misspelled">Azíz</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Azíz</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án-i-Sardár</mark>, which had struck down <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>, was the hand that
    dealt the fatal blow to the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s amanuensis and sometime <mark class="term unknown">fellow-prisoner</mark> in <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark><mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark>. I need not expatiate upon the circumstances of the death
    which that murderous <mark class="term unknown">Sardár</mark> inflicted upon him. Suffice it to say that he too, like those who went before, drank, in circumstances of shameful cruelty, the
    cup for which he had so long and so deeply yearned.
<p></p>I now proceed to relate what befell the remaining companions of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, those who had been privileged to share the horrors of the confinement with
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. From His own lips I have often heard the following account: “All those who were struck down by the storm that raged during that memorable year
    in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> were Our <mark class="term unknown">fellow-prisoners</mark> in the <mark class="term correct">Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál</mark>, where We were confined. We were all huddled together in one cell, our feet in stocks, and
around our necks fastened the most galling of chains. The air we breathed was laden with the foulest impurities, while the floor on which    <a name="Page_632"></a>we sat was covered with filth and infested with vermin. No ray of light was allowed to penetrate that pestilential dungeon or to
    warm its <mark class="term unknown">icy-coldness</mark>. We were placed in two rows, each facing the other. We had taught them to repeat certain verses which, every night, they chanted with
    extreme fervour. <mark class="term unknown">‘God</mark> is sufficient unto me; He verily is the <mark class="term unknown">All-sufficing</mark>!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> one row would intone, while the other would reply: <mark class="term unknown">‘In</mark> Him let the trusting
    trust.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The chorus of these gladsome voices would continue to peal out until the early hours of the morning. Their reverberation would fill the dungeon,
    and, piercing its massive walls, would reach the ears of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, whose palace was not far distant from the place where we were
imprisoned. <mark class="term unknown">‘What</mark> means this sound?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he was reported to have exclaimed. <mark class="term unknown">‘It</mark> is the anthem the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> are intoning in their prison,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> they replied. The    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> made no further remarks, nor did he attempt to restrain the enthusiasm his prisoners, despite the horrors of their confinement, continued to
    display.
<p></p>“One day, there was brought to Our prison a tray of roasted meat, which they informed Us the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> had ordered to be distributed among the prisoners.
    <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> We were told, <mark class="term unknown">‘faithful</mark> to a vow he made, has chosen this day to offer to you all this lamb in fulfilment of his pledge.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> A deep silence
    fell upon Our companions, who expected Us to make answer on their behalf. <mark class="term unknown">‘We</mark> return this gift to you,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> We replied; <mark class="term unknown">‘we</mark> can well dispense with this offer.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
    The answer We made would have greatly irritated the guards had they not been eager to devour the food we had refused to touch. Despite the hunger with
    which Our companions were afflicted, only one among them, a certain <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Ḥusayn-i-Matavalliy-i-Qumí</mark>, showed any desire to eat of the food the sovereign
    had chosen to spread before us. With a fortitude that was truly heroic, Our <mark class="term unknown">fellow-prisoners</mark> submitted, without a murmur, to endure the piteous plight to
    which they were reduced. Praise of God, instead of complaint of the treatment meted out to them by the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, fell unceasingly from their lips—praise
    with which they sought to beguile the hardships of a cruel captivity.
<p></p>“Every day Our gaolers, entering Our cell, would call the name of one of Our companions, bidding him arise and follow <a name="Page_633"></a>them to the
    foot of the gallows. With what eagerness would the owner of that name respond to that solemn call! Relieved of his chains, he would spring to his feet and,
    in a state of uncontrollable delight, would approach and embrace Us. We would seek to comfort him with the assurance of an everlasting life in the world
    beyond, and, filling his heart with hope and joy, would send him forth to win the crown of glory. He would embrace, in turn, the rest of his
    <mark class="term unknown">fellow-prisoners</mark> and then proceed to die as dauntlessly as he had lived. Soon after the martyrdom of each of these companions, We would be informed by the
    executioner, who had grown to be friendly to Us, of the circumstances of the death of his victim, and of the joy with which he had endured his sufferings
    to the very end.
<p></p>“We were awakened one night, ere break of day, by <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb-i-<u>Sh</u>írází</mark>, who was bound with Us to the same chains. He had left <mark class="term misspelled">Kazímayn</mark><mark class="term correction">Káẓimayn</mark> and
    followed Us to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, where he was arrested and thrown into prison. He asked Us whether We were awake, and proceeded to relate to Us his dream. <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> have
    this night,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he said, <mark class="term unknown">‘been</mark> soaring into a space of infinite vastness and beauty. I seemed to be uplifted on wings that carried me wherever I desired to
    go. A feeling of rapturous delight filled my soul. I flew in the midst of that immensity with a swiftness and ease that I cannot describe.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘To-day</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> We
    replied, <mark class="term unknown">‘it</mark> will be your turn to sacrifice yourself for this Cause. May you remain firm and steadfast to the end. You will then find yourself soaring in
    that same limitless space of which you dreamed, traversing with the same ease and swiftness the realm of immortal sovereignty, and gazing with that same
    rapture upon the Infinite Horizon.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark><p></p><p>“That morning saw the gaoler again enter Our cell and call out the name of <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>. Throwing off his chains, he sprang to his feet, embraced each of
    his <mark class="term unknown">fellow-prisoners</mark>, and, taking Us into his arms, pressed Us lovingly to his heart. That moment We discovered that he had no shoes to wear We gave him
    Our own, and, speaking a last word of encouragement and cheer, sent him forth to the scene of his martyrdom. Later on, his executioner came to Us, praising
    in glowing language the spirit which that youth had shown. <a name="Page_634"></a>How thankful We were to God for this testimony which the executioner
    himself had given!”
</p><p>All this suffering and the cruel revenge the authorities had taken on those who had attempted the life of their sovereign failed to appease the anger of
    the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s mother. Day and night she persisted in her vindictive clamour, demanding the execution of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, whom she still regarded as the
    real author of the crime. “Deliver him to the executioner!” she insistently cried to the authorities. “What greater humiliation than this, that I, who am
    the mother of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, should be powerless to inflict upon that criminal the punishment so dastardly an act deserves!” Her cry for vengeance, which
    an impotent rage served to intensify, was doomed to remain unanswered. Despite her machinations, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was saved from the fate she had so
    importunately striven to precipitate. The Prisoner was eventually released from His confinement, and was able to unfold and establish, beyond the confines
    of the kingdom of her son, a sovereignty the possibility of which she could never even have dreamed of. The blood shed in the course of that fateful year
    in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> by that heroic band with whom <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had been imprisoned, was the ransom paid for His deliverance from the hand of a foe that sought to
    prevent Him from achieving the purpose for which God had destined Him. Ever since the time He espoused the Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, He had never neglected one
    single occasion to champion the Faith He had embraced. He had exposed Himself to the perils which the followers of the Faith had to face in its early days.
    He was the first of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s disciples to set the example of renunciation and service to the Cause. Yet His life, beset as it was by the risks and dangers
    that a career such as His was sure to encounter, was spared by that same Providence who had chosen Him for a task which He, in His wisdom, deemed it as yet
    too soon to proclaim publicly.
</p>The terror that convulsed <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> was but one of the many risks and dangers to which <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s life was exposed. Men, women, and children in the capital
    trembled at the ruthlessness with which the enemy pursued their victims. A youth named <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás</mark>, a former servant of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, and fully
    informed, owing to the wide <a name="Page_635"></a>circle of friends whom his master cultivated, of the names the number, and the dwelling places of the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s disciples, was employed by the enemy as an instrument ready to hand for the prosecution of its designs. He had identified himself with the Faith of
    his master, and regarded himself as one of its zealous supporters. At the outset of the turmoil, he was arrested and compelled to betray all those whom he
    knew to be associated with the Faith. They sought by every manner of reward to induce him to reveal those who were his master’s <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>, and
    warned him that, should he refuse to disclose their names, he would be subjected to inhuman tortures. He pledged his word that he would act according to
    their wishes and would inform the assistants of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the <mark class="term unknown">Ḥajíbu’d-Dawlih</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Farrá<u>sh</u>-Bá<u>sh</u>í</mark>, of their names and abodes. He
    was taken through the streets of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and directed to point out everyone he recognised as being a follower of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. A number of people whom he had
    never met and known were in this manner delivered into the hands of <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>’s assistants—people who had never had any connection with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>
    and His Cause. These were able to recover their freedom only after having paid a heavy bribe to those who had captured them. Such was the greed of the
    <mark class="term unknown">Ḥajíbu’d-Dawlih</mark>’s attendants that they specially requested <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás</mark> to salute as a sign of betrayal every person who he thought would be willing and able to
    pay large sums for his deliverance. They would even force him to betray such persons, threatening that his refusal would be fraught with grave danger to
    his own life. They would frequently promise to give him a share of the money they determined to extort from their victims.
<p></p>This <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás</mark> was taken to the <mark class="term correct">Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál</mark> and introduced to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, whom he had met previously on several occasions in the company of his master,
    in the hope that he would betray Him. They promised that the mother of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> would amply reward him for such a betrayal. Every time he was taken
    into <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s presence, <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Abbás</mark>, after standing a few moments before Him and gazing upon His face, would leave the place, emphatically denying ever
    having seen Him. Having failed in their efforts, they resorted to poison, in the hope of obtaining the favour of the mother of <a name="Page_636"></a>their
    sovereign. They were able to intercept the food that their Prisoner was permitted to receive from His home, and mixed with it the poison they hoped would
    be fatal to Him. This measure, though impairing the health of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> for years, failed to achieve its purpose.
<p></p>The enemy was finally induced to cease regarding Him as the prime mover of that attempt, and decided to transfer the responsibility for this act to <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark>,
    whom they now accused of being the real author of the crime. By this means they endeavoured to obtain the favour of the mother of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, a favour
    they greatly coveted. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was only too happy to second their efforts. As he himself had taken no share in imprisoning <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, he
    seized upon the occasion which offered itself to denounce <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark>, whom he had already succeeded in arresting, as the chief and responsible instigator.
<p></p>The Russian minister, who, through one of his agents, was watching the developments of the situation and keeping in close touch with the condition of
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, addressed, through his interpreter, a strongly worded message to the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, in which he protested against his action, suggesting that a
    messenger should proceed, in the company of one of the government’s trusted representatives and of <mark class="term unknown">Ḥajíbu’d-Dawlih</mark>, to the <mark class="term correct">Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál</mark> and there ask
    the newly recognised leader to declare publicly his opinion regarding <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s position. “Whatever that leader may declare,” he wrote, “whether in
    praise or denunciation, I think ought to be immediately recorded and should serve as a basis for the final judgment which should be pronounced in this
    affair.”
<p></p><p>The Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> promised the interpreter that he would follow the minister’s advice, and even appointed a time for the messenger to join the government
    representative and <mark class="term unknown">Ḥajíbu’d-Dawlih</mark> and proceed with them to the <mark class="term correct">Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál</mark>.
</p>When <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark> was questioned as to whether he regarded <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> as the responsible leader of the group that had made the attempt on the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s life,
    he answered: “The Leader of this community was none other than the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>, who was slain in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, and whose martyrdom induced me to arise and
    avenge His death. I alone conceived this plan <a name="Page_637"></a>and endeavoured to execute it. The youth who threw the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> from his horse was
    none other than <mark class="term correct">Ṣádiq-i-Tabrízí</mark>, a servitor in a confectioner’s shop in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> who had been for two years in my service. He was fired with a desire even
    more burning than my own to avenge the martyrdom of his Leader. He acted too hastily, however, and failed to make certain the success of his attempt.”
<p></p><p>The words of his declaration were taken down by both the minister’s interpreter and the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>’s representative, who submitted their records to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>
    <mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. The documents which were placed in his hands were chiefly responsible for <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s release from His imprisonment.
</p><mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark> was accordingly delivered into the hands of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark>, who, though themselves anxious to hasten his death, were prevented by the hesitancy of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term unknown">Abu’l</mark><mark class="term correct">Qásim</mark>, the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. <mark class="term unknown">Ḥajíbu’d-Dawlih</mark>, because of the near approach of the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Muharram</mark><mark class="term correction">Muḥarram</mark>, induced the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> to assemble on the
    upper floor of the barracks, where he succeeded in obtaining the presence of the <mark class="term misspelled">Imám-Jum’ih</mark><mark class="term correction">Imám-Jum‘ih</mark>, who still persisted in his refusal to consent to the death of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark>. He directed that the accused be brought to that place and there await the judgment that was to be pronounced against him. He was roughly conducted
    through the streets, overwhelmed with ridicule, and reviled by the populace. Through a subtle device which the enemy had contrived, they succeeded in
    obtaining a verdict for death. A siyyid armed with a club rushed at him and smashed his head. His example was followed by the people, who, with sticks,
    stones, and daggers, fell upon him and mutilated his body. <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Jání</mark> also was among those who suffered martyrdom in the course of the agitation that
    followed the attempt on the life of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>. Owing to the disinclination of the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> to harm him, he was secretly put to death.
<p></p>The conflagration kindled in the capital spread to the adjoining provinces, bringing in its wake devastation and misery to countless innocent people among
    the subjects of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>. It ravaged <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, the home of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, and was the signal for acts of violence which were directed mainly against
    all His possessions in that province. Two of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s devoted disciples, <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> and <a name="Page_638"></a><mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>, both
    residents of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, suffered martyrdom as the result of that turmoil.
<p></p>The enemies of the Faith, finding to their disappointment that <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s deliverance from prison was almost assured, sought by intimidating their
    sovereign to involve Him ill fresh complications and thus encompass His death. The folly of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark>, who, driven by his idle hopes, had sought to
    secure for himself and the band of his foolish supporters a supremacy which hitherto he had in vain laboured to obtain, served as a further pretext for the
    enemy to urge the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> to take drastic measures for the destruction of whatever influence his Prisoner still retained in <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>.
<p></p>The alarming reports received by the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, who had scarcely recovered from his wounds, stirred in him a terrible thirst for revenge. He summoned the
    Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> and reprimanded him for having failed to maintain order and discipline among the people of his own province, who were bound to him by ties of
    kinship. Disconcerted by the rebuke of his sovereign, he expressed his readiness to fulfil whatever he would direct him to do. He was bidden despatch
immediately to that province several regiments, with strict orders to repress with a ruthless hand the disturbers of the public peace.    <a name="Page_639"></a>The Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, though fully aware of the exaggerated character of the reports that had been submitted to him, found himself compelled, owing to the    <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s insistence, to order the despatch of the <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>áh-Sun</mark> regiment, headed by <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term unknown"><u>Kh</u>án-i-<u>Sh</u>áh-Sun</mark>, to the village of
<mark class="term misspelled">Tákúr</mark><mark class="term correction">Tákur</mark>, in the district of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark>, where the home of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was situated. He gave the supreme command into the hands of his nephew, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abú-Talíb</mark><mark class="term correction">Abú-Ṭálib</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, <mark class="term unknown">brother-in-law</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, who was <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s <mark class="term unknown">half-brother</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> urged him to exercise the utmost caution and
    restraint while encamping in that village. “Whatever excesses,” he urged him, “are committed by your men will react unfavourably on the prestige of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark> and be the cause of affliction to your own sister.” He bade him investigate the nature of these reports and not to encamp more than three days in the
    vicinity of that village.
<p></p>The Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> afterwards summoned <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> and exhorted him to conduct himself with the utmost circumspection and wisdom. “<mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abú-Talíb</mark><mark class="term correction">Abú-Ṭálib</mark>,” he said, is still young and inexperienced. I have specially chosen him owing to his kinship to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>. I trust that he will, for the sake
    of his sister, refrain from causing unnecessary injury to the inhabitants of <mark class="term misspelled">Tákúr</mark><mark class="term correction">Tákur</mark>. Being superior to him in age and experience, you must set him a noble
    example and impress on him the necessity of serving the interests of both government and people. You must never allow him to undertake any operations
    without having previously consulted with you.” He assured <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> that he had issued written instructions to the chieftains of that
    district, calling upon them to come to his assistance whenever required.
<p></p><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abú-Talíb</mark><mark class="term correction">Abú-Ṭálib</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, flushed with pride and enthusiasm, forgot the counsels of moderation the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> had given him. He refused to be
    influenced by the pressing appeals of <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who entreated him not to provoke an unnecessary conflict with the people. No sooner had he
    reached the pass which divided the district of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> from the adjoining province, which was not far distant from <mark class="term misspelled">Tákúr</mark><mark class="term correction">Tákur</mark>, than he ordered his men to prepare
for an attack upon the people of that village. <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-‘Alí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> ran to him in despair and begged him to refrain from such an act. “It is    <a name="Page_640"></a>for me,” <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abú-Talíb</mark><mark class="term correction">Abú-Ṭálib</mark> haughtily retorted, “who am your superior, to decide what measures should be taken and in what manner I
    should serve my sovereign.”
<p></p><p>A sudden attack was launched upon the defenceless people of <mark class="term misspelled">Tákúr</mark> <mark class="term correction">Tákur</mark>. Surprised by so unexpected and fierce an onslaught, they appealed to <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, who
asked to be introduced into the presence of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Abú-Talíb</mark> <mark class="term correction">Abú-Ṭálib</mark> but was refused admittance. “Tell him,” was the commander’s message, that    <a name="Page_641"></a>I am charged by my sovereign to order a wholesale massacre of the people of this village, to capture its women and confiscate their
    property. For your sake, however, I am willing to spare such women as take refuge in your house.”
</p><p><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, indignant at this refusal, severely censured him and, denouncing the action of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, returned to his home. The men of that village
    had meanwhile left their dwellings and sought refuge in the neighbouring mountains. Their women, abandoned to their fate, betook themselves to the home of
    <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, whom they implored to protect them from the enemy.
</p>The first act of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abú-Talíb</mark><mark class="term correction">Abú-Ṭálib</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was directed against the house <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had inherited from the <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark>, His father, and of which He was the
    sole possessor. That house had been royally furnished and was decorated with vessels of inestimable value. He ordered his men to break open all its
    treasuries and to take away their contents. Such things as he was unable to carry away, he ordered to be destroyed. Some were shattered, others were
    burned. Even the rooms, which were more stately than those of the palaces of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, were disfigured beyond repair; the beams were burned down and the
    decorations utterly ruined.
<p></p>He next turned to the houses of the people, which he levelled with the ground, appropriating to himself and his men whatever valuables they contained. The
    entire village, despoiled and deserted by its men inhabitants, was delivered to the flames. Not able to find any <mark class="term unknown">able-bodied</mark> men, he ordered that a search
    be conducted in the neighbouring mountains. Any who were found were to be either shot or captured. All they could lay their hands upon were a few aged men
    and shepherds who had been unable to proceed further afield in their flight from the enemy. They discovered two men lying in the distance on the slopes of
    a mountain beside a running brook. Their weapons gleaming under the rays of the sun had betrayed them. Finding them asleep, they shot them both from across
    the brook which intervened between the assailants and their victims. They recognised them as <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. The former was
    shot dead, while the latter was severely wounded. They were carried into the presence of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abú-Talíb</mark><mark class="term correction">Abú-Ṭálib</mark>, <a name="Page_642"></a>who did his best to
    preserve the life of the victim whom he wished, owing to his <mark class="term unknown">far-famed</mark> courage, to take with him to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> as a trophy of his victory. His efforts failed,
    however, for <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Taqí</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, two days after, died from his wounds. The few men they had been able to capture were led in chains to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and
    thrown into the same underground dungeon where <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had been confined. Among them was <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term unknown">‘Alí-Bábá</mark>, who, together with a number of his
    <mark class="term unknown">fellow-prisoners</mark>, perished in that dungeon as a result of the hardships he had endured.
<p></p>The year after, this same <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Abú-Talíb</mark><mark class="term correction">Abú-Ṭálib</mark> was stricken with plague and taken in a state of wretched misery to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>imírán</mark>. Shunned by even his nearest
    kindred, he lay on his <mark class="term unknown">sick-bed</mark> until this same <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥasan</mark>, whom he had so haughtily insulted, offered to tend his sores and bear him company in his days
    of humiliation and loneliness. He was on the brink of death when the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> visited him and found none at his bedside but the one whom he had so
    rudely treated. That very day that wretched tyrant expired, bitterly disappointed at the failure of all the hopes he had fondly cherished.
<p></p>The commotion that had seized <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, the effects of which had been severely felt in <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> and the surrounding district, spread as far as <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>,
    where a considerable number of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s disciples were seized and inhumanly martyred. The whole of Persia seemed, indeed, to have felt the shock of that
    great convulsion. Its tide swept as far as the remotest hamlets of the distant provinces, and brought in its wake untold sufferings to the remnants of a
    persecuted community. Governors, no less than their subordinates, inflamed with greed and revenge, seized the occasion to enrich themselves and obtain the
    favour of their sovereign. Without mercy, moderation, or shame, they employed any means, however base and lawless, to extort from the innocent the benefits
    they themselves coveted. Forsaking every principle of justice and decency, they arrested, imprisoned, and tortured whomsoever they suspected of being a
    <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>, and would hasten to inform <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> of the victories achieved over a detested opponent.
<p></p>In <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> the full effects of that turmoil revealed themselves <a name="Page_643"></a>in the treatment accorded by its rulers and people to the followers
    of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. About two months after the attempt on the life of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, a young man named <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, whose exceptional courage had earned for him
    the surname of <mark class="term correct">‘Alíy-i-Sardár</mark>, distinguished himself by the extreme solicitude he extended to the survivors of the struggle which ended with the death of
    <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark> and his supporters. He was often seen in the darkness of the night to emerge from his shelter, carrying whatever aid was in his power to the widows
    and orphans who had suffered from the consequences of that tragedy. To those in need he distributed food and garments with noble generosity, tended their
    injuries, and comforted them in their sorrow. The sight of the continuous sufferings of these innocent ones stirred the fierce indignation of some of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>’s companions, who undertook to wreak their vengeance upon <mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, who was still dwelling in <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> and whom they regarded as the
    author of their misfortunes. Believing that he had still in his heart a desire to subject them to even further afflictions, they determined to take his
    life. They surprised him in the public bath, where they succeeded in accomplishing their purpose. This led to an upheaval that recalled in its concluding
    stages the horror of the butcheries of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>.
<p></p><mark class="term misspelled">Zaynu’l-Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correction">Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>’s widow pressed <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Na’ím</mark><mark class="term correction">Na‘ím</mark>, who held the reins of authority in his grasp and was then residing in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, to avenge the
    blood of her husband, promising that she would in return bestow all her jewels upon him and would transfer to his name whatever he might desire of her
    possessions. Through treachery, the authorities succeeded in capturing a considerable number of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s followers, many of whom were savagely beaten. All
    were thrown into prison, pending the receipt of instructions from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. The Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> submitted the list of names he had received, together with the
    report that accompanied it, to the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, who expressed his extreme satisfaction at the success that had attended the efforts of his representative
    in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, and whom he amply rewarded for his signal service. He asked that all those who were captured be brought to the capital.
<p></p>I shall not attempt to record the various circumstances that led to the carnage which marked the termination of <a name="Page_644"></a>that episode. I
    would refer my reader to the graphic and detailed account which <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>afí-i-Nayrízí</mark> has written in a separate booklet, in which he refers with
    accuracy and force to every detail of that moving event. Suffice it to say that no less than one hundred and eighty of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s valiant disciples suffered
    martyrdom. A like number were wounded and, though incapacitated by their injuries, were ordered to leave for <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. Only <mark class="term unknown">twenty-eight</mark> persons among them
    survived the hardships of the journey to the capital. Of these <mark class="term unknown">twenty-eight</mark>, fifteen were taken to the gallows on the very day of their arrival. The rest
    were thrown into prison and made to suffer for two years the most horrible atrocities. Though eventually released, many of them perished on their way to
    their homes, exhausted by the trials of a long and cruel captivity.
<p></p>A large number of their <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark> were slain in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> by order of <mark class="term unknown">Tahmásb-Mírzá</mark>. The heads of two hundred of these victims were placed on
    bayonets and carried triumphantly by their oppressors to <mark class="term unknown">Ábádih</mark>, a village in <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark>. They were intending to take them to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, when a royal messenger
    commanded them to abandon their project, whereupon they decided to bury the heads in that village.
<p></p>As to the women, who were six hundred in number, half of them were released in <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, while the rest were carried, <a name="Page_645"></a>each two being
    forced to ride together on an unsaddled horse, to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, where, after being submitted to severe tortures, they were abandoned to their fate. Many
    perished on their way to that city; many yielded up their lives to the afflictions they were made to endure ere they recovered their freedom. My pen
    shrinks in horror in attempting to describe what befell those valiant men and women who were made to suffer so severely for their Faith. The wanton
    barbarity that characterised the treatment meted out to them reached the lowest depths of infamy in the concluding stages of that lamentable episode. What
    I have attempted to recount of the horrors of the siege of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, of the indignities heaped upon <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> and his supporters, pales before the glaring
    ferocity of the atrocities perpetrated a few years later in <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> and <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. A pen abler than mine to describe in all their tragic details these
    unspeakable savageries will, I trust, be found to place on record a tale which, however grim its features, must ever remain as one of the noblest evidences
    of the faith which the Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was able to inspire in His followers.<a href="#_ftn646" name="_ftnref646" title="">[††]</a><a name="Page_646"></a>The confession of <mark class="term misspelled">Aẓím</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Aẓím</mark> freed <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> from the danger to which His life had been exposed. The circumstances of the death of him who had declared himself
    the chief instigator of that crime served to abate the wrath with which an enraged populace clamoured for the immediate punishment of so daring an attempt.
    The cries of rage and vengeance, the appeals for immediate retribution, which had hitherto been focussed on <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> were now diverted from Him. The
    ferocity of those claimant denunciations was, by degrees, much allayed. The conviction grew firmer in the minds of the responsible authorities in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>
    that <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> hitherto regarded as the <mark class="term unknown">arch-foe</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><a name="Page_647"></a><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, was by no means involved in any conspiracy against
    the sovereign’s life. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> was therefore encouraged to send his trusted representative, a man named <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, to the <mark class="term correct">Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál</mark>,
    and to present the order for His release to the Prisoner.
<p></p>Upon his arrival, the sight which the emissary beheld filled him with grief and surprise. The spectacle which met his eyes was one he could scarcely
    believe. He wept as he saw <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> chained to a floor that was infested with vermin, His neck weighed down by galling chains, His face laden with
sorrow, ungroomed and dishevelled, breathing the pestilential atmosphere of the most terrible of dungeons. <a name="Page_648"></a>“Accursed be <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>!” he burst forth, as his eyes recognised <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in the gloom that surrounded Him. “God knows I had never imagined that you could have been
    subjected to so humiliating a captivity. I should never have thought that the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> could have dared commit so heinous an act.”
<p></p><p>He removed the mantle from his shoulders and presented it to <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, entreating Him to wear it when in the presence of the minister and his
    counsellors. <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> refused his request, and, wearing the dress of a prisoner, proceeded straightway to the seat of the imperial government. The first
    word the Grand <mark class="term correct">Vazír</mark> was moved to address to his Captive was the following: “Had you chosen to take my advice, and had you dissociated yourself from the
    faith of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid-i-Báb</mark>, you would never have suffered the pains and indignities that have been heaped upon you.” “Had you, in your turn,” <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>
    replied, “followed my counsels, the affairs of the government would not have reached so critical a stage.”
</p><p>He was immediately reminded of the conversation he had <a name="Page_649"></a>had with Him on the occasion of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s martyrdom. The words, “the flame
    that has been kindled will blaze forth more fiercely than ever,” flashed through the mind of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. “The warning you uttered,” he remarked,
    “has, alas been fulfilled. What is it that you advise me now to do?” “Command the governors of the realm,” was the instant reply, “to cease shedding the
    blood of the innocent, to cease plundering their property, to cease dishonouring their women and injuring their children. Let them cease the persecution of
    the Faith of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>; let them abandon the idle hope of wiping out its followers.” <a name="Page_650"></a>That same day orders were given, through a circular addressed to all the governors of the realm, bidding them desist from their acts of cruelty and shame.
    “What you have done is enough,” <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Áqá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> wrote them. “Cease arresting and punishing the people. Disturb no longer the peace and tranquillity
    of your countrymen.” The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s government had been deliberating as to the most effective measures that should be taken to rid the country, once and
    for all, of the curse with which it had been afflicted. No sooner had <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> recovered His freedom than the decision of the government was handed to
    Him, informing Him that within a month of the issuing of this order, He, with His family, was expected to leave <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> for a place beyond the confines of
    Persia.
</p>The Russian minister, as soon as he learned of the action which the government contemplated taking, volunteered to take <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> under his protection,
    and invited Him to go to Russia. He refused the offer and chose instead to leave for <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>. Nine months after His return from <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, on the first day of
    the month of <mark class="term misspelled">Rabí’u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark><mark class="term correction">Rabí‘u’<u>th</u>-<u>Th</u>ání</mark>, in the year 1269 A.H.,<a href="#_ftn647" name="_ftnref647" title="">[‡‡]</a><mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, accompanied by the
members of His family, among whom were the Most Great Branch<a href="#_ftn648" name="_ftnref648" title="">[§§]</a> and <mark class="term correct">Áqáy-i-Kalím</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn649" name="_ftnref649" title="">[***]</a> and escorted by a member of the imperial <mark class="term unknown">body-guard</mark> and an official representing the Russian
    legation, set out from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> on His journey to <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>. <a name="Page_651"></a>EPILOGUENEVER had the fortunes of the Faith proclaimed by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> sunk to a lower ebb than when <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was banished from His native land to <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>. The Cause
    for which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had given His life, for which <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> had toiled and suffered, seemed to be on the very verge of extinction. Its force appeared to
    have been spent, its resistance irretrievably broken. Discouragements and disasters, each more devastating in its effect than the preceding one, had
    succeeded one another with bewildering rapidity, sapping its vitality and dimming the hope of its stoutest supporters. Indeed, to a superficial reader of
    the pages of <mark class="term correct">Nabíl</mark>’s narrative, the whole story from its very beginning appears to be a mere recital of reverses and massacres, of humiliations and
    disappointments, each more severe than the previous one, culminating at last in the banishment of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> from His own country. To the sceptical
    reader, unwilling to recognise the celestial potency with which that Faith was endowed, the entire conception that had evolved in the mind of its Author
    seems to have been foredoomed to failure. The work of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, so gloriously conceived, so heroically undertaken, would appear to have ended in a colossal
    disaster. To such a reader, the life of the <mark class="term unknown">ill-fated</mark> Youth of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> would seem, judging from the cruel blows it sustained, to be one of the
    saddest and most fruitless that had ever been the lot of mortal men. That short and heroic career, which, swift as a meteor, flashed across the firmament
    of Persia, and seemed for a time to have brought the <mark class="term unknown">longed-for</mark> light of eternal salvation into the gloom that encircled the country, was plunged at last
    into an abyss of darkness and despair.
<p></p>Every step He took, every endeavour He made, had but served to intensify the sorrows and disappointments that weighed upon His soul. The plan He had, at
the very outset of His career, conceived of inaugurating His Mission with a public proclamation in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina    <a name="Page_652"></a>failed to materialise as He had hoped. The Sherif of Mecca, to whom <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> was bidden deliver His Message, accorded him a reception
    that betrayed by its icy indifference the contemptuous disregard in which the Cause of a Youth of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> was held by the ruler of <mark class="term correct">Ḥijáz</mark> and
    custodian of its <mark class="term misspelled">Ka’bih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ka‘bih</mark>. The project He had in mind of returning triumphantly from His pilgrimage to the cities of <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Najaf</mark>, where He hoped to
    establish His Cause, in the very heart of that stronghold of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ah</mark><mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ah</mark> orthodoxy, was likewise hopelessly shattered. The programme which He had thought
    out, the essentials of which He had already communicated to the chosen nineteen of His disciples, remained for the most part unfulfilled. The moderation He
    had exhorted them to observe was forgotten in the first flush of enthusiasm that seized the early missionaries of His Faith, which behaviour was in no
    small measure responsible for the failure of the hopes He had so fondly cherished. The <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark>, that wise and sagacious ruler, who had so ably warded off
    the danger with which that precious Life was threatened, and who had proved his capacity to render Him services of such distinction as few of His more
    modest companions could have hoped to offer, was suddenly taken from Him, leaving Him at the mercy of the perfidious <mark class="term correct">Gurgín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the most
    detestable and unscrupulous of all His enemies. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s only chance of meeting <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>—a meeting which He Himself had requested and on which
    He had pinned His fondest hopes—was dashed to the ground by the intervention of the cowardly and capricious <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark><mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, who trembled at the thought
    lest His contact with the sovereign, already unduly inclined to befriend that Cause, should prove fatal to his own interests. The attempts, inspired and
    initiated by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, which two of His foremost disciples, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term misspelled">‘Alíy-i-Bastamí</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Alíy-i-Basṭámí</mark> and <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Sa’íd-i-Hindí</mark><mark class="term correction">Sa‘íd-i-Hindí</mark>, had made to introduce the Faith,
    the one in Turkish territory and the other in India, ended in dismal failure. The first enterprise collapsed at its very outset by reason of the cruel
    martyrdom of its promoter, whilst the latter was productive of what might seem a negligible result, its only fruit being the conversion of a certain siyyid
    whose chequered career of service was brought to a sudden end in <mark class="term unknown">Luristán</mark> by the action of the treacherous <mark class="term unknown">Íldírím</mark><a name="Page_653"></a><mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>. The
captivity to which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> Himself, during the greater part of the years of His ministry, was condemned; His isolation in the mountain fastnesses of <mark class="term unknown">Á</mark><mark class="term unknown"><u>dh</u>irbayján</mark> from the body of His followers, who were being sorely tried by a rapacious enemy; above all, the tragedy of His own martyrdom, so
    intense, so terribly humiliating, would appear to have marked the lowest depths of ignominy which so noble a Cause, from the very hour of its birth, was
    doomed to suffer. His death, the culmination of a swift and stormy career, would seem to have set the seal of failure upon a task which, however heroic in
    the efforts it inspired, was impossible of achievement.
<p></p>Much as He Himself had suffered, the agony He was made to endure was but a drop compared to the calamities which were to rain down upon the multitude of
    His avowed followers. The cup of sorrow that had touched His lips had yet to be drained to its very dregs by those who still remained after Him. The
    catastrophe of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark><mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, which robbed Him of His ablest lieutenants, <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, and which engulfed no less than three
    hundred and thirteen of His staunch companions, came as the cruelest blow that had yet fallen upon Him, and enveloped with a shroud of darkness the closing
    days of His <mark class="term unknown">fast-ebbing</mark> life. The struggle of <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, with its attendant horrors and cruelties, involving as it did the loss of <mark class="term misspelled">Vahíd</mark><mark class="term correction">Vaḥíd</mark>, the most learned,
    the most influential, and the most accomplished among the followers of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, was an added blow to the resources and numbers of those who continued to
    hold aloft the torch in their hands. The siege of <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark>, following closely in the wake of the disaster that had befallen the Faith in <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark>, and marked
    by the butcheries with which the name of that province will ever remain associated, depleted still further the ranks of the upholders of the Faith, and
    deprived them of the sustaining strength with which the presence of <mark class="term misspelled">Hujjat</mark><mark class="term correction">Ḥujjat</mark> inspired them. With him was gone the last outstanding figure among the
    representative leaders of the Faith who towered, by virtue of their ecclesiastical authority, their learning, their fearlessness and force of character,
    above the rank and file of their <mark class="term unknown">fellow-disciples</mark>. The flower of the <a name="Page_654"></a><mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s followers had been mown down in a ruthless carnage,
    leaving behind it a vast company of enslaved women and children, who groaned beneath the yoke of an unrelenting foe. Their leaders, who, alike by their
    knowledge and example, had fed and sustained the flame that glowed in those valiant hearts, had also perished, their work seemingly abandoned amidst the
    confusion that afflicted a persecuted community.
<p></p>Of all those who had shown themselves capable of carrying on the work which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had handed down to His followers, <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> alone remained.    <a href="#_ftn650" name="_ftnref650" title="">[†††]</a> All the rest had fallen by the sword of the enemy. <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark>, the nominal leader of the band that
    survived the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, had ingloriously sought refuge in the mountains of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> from the perils of the turmoil that had seized the capital. In the guise of
    a dervish, <mark class="term unknown">ka<u>sh</u>kúl</mark><a href="#_ftn651" name="_ftnref651" title="">[‡‡‡]</a> in hand, he had deserted his companions and fled the scene of danger to
    the forests of <mark class="term correct">Gílán</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark><mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s amanuensis, and <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark><mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, his collaborator, who were both <mark class="term unknown">well-versed</mark> in the teachings and implications
    of the newly revealed <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark> and, by virtue of their intimacy with their Master and their familiarity with the precepts of His Faith, were in a position to
    enlighten the understanding, and consolidate the foundations of the faith, of their companions, lay in chains in the <mark class="term correct">Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, cut off
    entirely from the body of the believers who so greatly needed their counsel, both doomed to suffer, at an early date, a cruel martyrdom. Even His own
    maternal uncle, who, ever since His childhood, had surrounded Him with a paternal solicitude that no father could have surpassed, who had rendered Him
signal services in the early days of His sufferings in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, and who, had he been allowed to survive Him by only a few years, could have rendered    <a name="Page_655"></a>inestimable services to His Cause, languished in prison, forlorn and hopeless of ever continuing the work that was so close to his
    heart. <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark><mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>, that flaming emblem of His Cause who, alike by her indomitable courage, her impetuous character, her dauntless faith, her fiery ardour and
    vast knowledge, seemed for a time able to win the whole womanhood of Persia to the Cause of her Beloved, fell, alas, at the very hour when victory seemed
    near at hand, a victim to the wrath of a calumnious enemy. The influence of her work, the course of which was so prematurely arrested, seemed to those who
    stood near as they lowered her into the pit that served as her grave, to have been completely extinguished. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s remaining Letters of the Living
    either had perished by the sword or were fettered in prison, or again were leading an obscure life in some remote corner of the realm. The body of the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s voluminous writings suffered, for the most part, a fate no less humiliating than that which had befallen His disciples. Many of His copious works
    were utterly obliterated, others were torn and reduced to ashes, a few were corrupted, much was seized by the enemy, and the rest lay a mass of
    disorganised and undeciphered manuscripts, precariously hidden and widely scattered among the survivors of His companions.
<p></p>The Faith the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had proclaimed, and for which He had given His all, had indeed reached its lowest ebb. The fires kindled against it had almost consumed
    the fabric upon which its continued existence depended. The wings of death seemed to be hovering above it. Extermination, complete and irremediable,
    appeared to be threatening its very life. Amidst the shadows that were fast gathering about it, the figure of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> alone shone as the potential
    Deliverer of a Cause that was fast speeding to its end. The marks of clear vision, of courage and sagacity which He had shown on more than one occasion
    ever since He had risen to champion the Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, appeared to qualify Him, should His life and continued existence in Persia be ensured, to revive
    the fortunes of an expiring Faith. But this was not to be. A catastrophe, unexampled in the whole history of that Faith, precipitated a persecution fiercer
    than any that had <a name="Page_656"></a>hitherto taken place, and this time drew into its vortex the person of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> Himself. The slender hopes
    which the remnants of the believers still entertained were wrecked amidst the confusion that ensued. For <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, their only hope and the sole object
    of their confidence, was so struck down by the severity of that storm that no recovery could any longer be thought possible. After He had been despoiled of
    all His possessions in <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, denounced as the prime mover of a dastardly attempt upon the life of His sovereign, abandoned by His kindred and
    despised by His former friends and admirers, plunged into a dark and pestilential dungeon, and at last, with the members of His family, driven into
    hopeless exile beyond the confines of His native land, all the hopes that had centred round Him as the possible Redeemer of an afflicted Faith seemed for a
    moment to have completely vanished.
<p></p>No wonder <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, under whose eyes and by whose impulse such blows were being dealt, was already priding himself on being the wrecker of
    a Cause against which he had so consistently battled, and which he had at last, to outward seeming, been able to crush. No wonder he imagined, as he sat
    musing over the successive stages of this vast and bloody enterprise, that by the act of banishment which his hands had signed, he was sounding the
    <mark class="term unknown">death-knell</mark> of that hateful heresy which had struck such terror to the hearts of his people. To <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> it appeared, at that supreme
    moment, that the spell of that terror was broken, that the tide that had swept over his country was at last turning and bringing back to his
    <mark class="term unknown">fellow-countrymen</mark> the peace for which they cried. Now that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was no more; now that the mighty pillars that sustained His Cause had been crushed into
    dust; now that the mass of its devotees, throughout the length and breadth of his dominion, were cowed and exhausted; now that <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> Himself, the one
remaining hope of a leaderless community, had been driven into exile and had, of His own accord, sought refuge in the neighbourhood of the stronghold <mark class="term unknown">of<u>sh</u>í’ah</mark> fanaticism, the spectre that had haunted him ever since he had ascended the throne had vanished for ever. Never again, he imagined,    <a name="Page_657"></a>would he hear of that detestable Movement which, if he were to believe his best counsellors, was swiftly receding into the shadows
    of impotence and oblivion.<a href="#_ftn652" name="_ftnref652" title="">[§§§]</a><p></p>To even the followers of the Faith who were left to survive the abominations heaped upon their Cause—to even that small caravan, with perhaps a few
exceptions, wending its way in the depth of winter through the snows of the mountains bordering on <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>,    <a href="#_ftn653" name="_ftnref653" title="">[****]</a> the Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, one can well imagine, might for a moment have seemed to have failed in
    accomplishing its purpose. The forces of darkness that had encompassed it on every side would seem to have at last triumphed over, and put out, the light
    which that young Prince of Glory had kindled in His land.
<p></p>In the eyes of <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, at all events, the power that had seemed for a time to have swept within its orbit the entire forces of his realm
    had ceased to count. <mark class="term unknown">Ill-starred</mark> from its very birth, it had eventually been forced to surrender to the violence of the blows which his sword had dealt.
    The Faith had suffered a disruption certainly well deserved. Delivered from its curse, which for many nights had robbed him of his sleep, he could now,
    with undivided attention, set about the task of rescuing his land from the devastating effects of that vast delusion. Henceforth his real mission, as he
    conceived it, was to enable both Church and State to consolidate their foundations and to reinforce their ranks against the intrusion of similar heresies,
    which might, in a future day, poison the life of his countrymen.
<p></p>How vain were his imaginings, how vast his own delusion! The Cause he had fondly imagined to have been crushed was still living, destined to emerge from
    the midst of that great convulsion stronger, purer, and nobler than ever. The Cause <a name="Page_658"></a>which, to the mind of that foolish monarch,
    seemed to be speeding towards destruction was but passing through the fiery tests of a phase of transition that was to carry it a step further on the path
    of its high destiny. A new chapter in its history was being unfolded, more glorious than any that had marked its birth or its rise. The repression which
    that monarch had believed to have succeeded in sealing its doom was but the initial stage in an evolution destined to blossom, in the fulness of time, into
    a Revelation mightier than any that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> Himself had proclaimed. The seed His hand had sown, though subjected, for a time, to the fury of a storm of
    unexampled violence and though later transplanted to a foreign soil, was to continue to develop and grow, in due time, into a Tree destined to spread its
    shelter over all the kindreds and peoples of the earth. Though the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s disciples might be tortured and slain, and His companions humiliated and crushed;
    though His followers might dwindle in number; though the voice of the Faith itself might be silenced by the arm of violence; though despair might settle
    upon its fortunes; though its ablest defenders might apostatise from their faith, yet the promise embedded within the shell of His word no hand could
    succeed in ravishing, and no power stand in the way of its germination and growth.
<p></p>Indeed, the first glimmerings of the dawning Revelation, of which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> had declared Himself to be the Herald, and to the approach and certainty of which
    He had so repeatedly alluded,<a href="#_ftn654" name="_ftnref654" title="">[††††]</a> could already be discerned amidst the gloom that encircled
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> in the <mark class="term correct">Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>.<a href="#_ftn655" name="_ftnref655" title="">[‡‡‡‡]</a> The <a name="Page_659"></a>force that, growing out
    of the momentous Revelation released by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, was at a later time to unfold itself in all its glory and encompass the globe, was already pulsating in
    the veins of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> as He lay exposed in His cell to the sword of His executioner. The still voice which, in the hour of bitter agony, announced to
    the Prisoner the Revelation of which He was chosen to be the Mouthpiece, could not, of a certainty, have reached the ears of the monarch who was already
    preparing the celebration of the extinction of the Faith his Captive had championed. That imprisonment which he who had caused it, believed to have branded
    with infamy the fair name of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, and which he regarded as a prelude to a still more humiliating banishment to <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, was, indeed, the very scene
    that witnessed the first stirrings of that Movement of which <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> was to be the Author, a Movement which was first to be made known in the city of
    <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark> and at a later time to be proclaimed from the <mark class="term unknown">prison-city</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled">Akká</mark><mark class="term correction">‘Akká</mark> to the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, no less than to the other rulers and crowned heads of
    the world.
<p></p>Little did <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> imagine that by the very act of pronouncing the sentence of banishment against <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> he was helping in the
    unfolding of God’s irrepressible Purpose and that he himself was but an instrument in the execution of that Design. Little did he imagine that as his reign
    was drawing to a close it would witness a revival of the very forces he had sought so strenuously to exterminate—a revival that would manifest a vitality
such as he, in the hour of darkest despair, had never believed that Faith to possess. Not only within the confines of his own realm,    <a href="#_ftn656" name="_ftnref656" title="">[§§§§]</a><a name="Page_660"></a>not only throughout the adjacent territories of <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark> and Russia, but as
    far as India in the East,<a href="#_ftn657" name="_ftnref657" title="">[*****]</a> as far as Egypt and European Turkey in the West, a recrudescence of the
    Faith such as he had never expected, awakened him from the dreams in which he had so fondly indulged. The Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> seemed as if risen from the
    dead. It appeared under a form infinitely more formidable than any under which it had appeared in the past. The fresh impetus which, despite his
    calculations, the personality of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, and, above all, the inherent strength of the Revelation which He personified, had lent to the Cause of the
    <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, was one <mark class="term unknown">Náṣiri’d</mark><mark class="term unknown">Dín</mark><mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> had never imagined. The rapidity with which a <a name="Page_661"></a>slumbering Faith had been revived and
    consolidated within his own territory; its spreading out to States beyond its confines; the stupendous claims advanced by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> almost in the midst
    of the stronghold where He had chosen to dwell; the public declaration of that claim in European Turkey, and its proclamation in challenging Epistles to
the crowned heads of the earth, one of which the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> himself was destined to receive; the enthusiasm that announcement evoked in the    <a name="Page_662"></a>hearts of countless followers; the transference to the Holy Land of the centre of His Cause; the gradual relaxation of the severity
    of His confinement which marked the closing days of His life; the lifting of the ban that had been imposed by the <mark class="term correct">Sulṭán</mark> of Turkey on His intercourse with
    visitors and pilgrims who flocked from various parts of the East to His prison; the awakening of the spirit of enquiry among the thinkers of the West; the
    utter disruption of the forces that had attempted to effect a schism in the ranks of His followers, and the fate that had befallen its chief instigator;
    above all, <a name="Page_663"></a>the sublimity of those teachings with which His published works abounded and which were being read, disseminated, and
    taught by an <mark class="term unknown">ever-increasing</mark> number of adherents in Russian <mark class="term unknown">Turkistán</mark>, in <mark class="term correct">‘Iráq</mark>, in India, in Syria, and as far off as European Turkey—these were among the
    chief factors that convincingly revealed to the eyes of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> the invincible character of a Faith he believed himself to have bridled and
    destroyed. The futility of his efforts, however much he might attempt to conceal his feelings, was only too apparent. The Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, the birth and
    tribulations of which he had himself witnessed, and the triumphant progress of which he was now beholding, had risen <mark class="term unknown">phoenix-like</mark> from its ashes and was
    pressing forward along the road leading to <mark class="term unknown">undreamt-of</mark> achievements.<a href="#_ftn658" name="_ftnref658" title="">[†††††]</a><a name="Page_664"></a>Little did <mark class="term correct">Nabíl</mark> himself imagine that within twoscore years of the writing of his narrative the Revelation of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, the flower and fruit of all the
    Dispensations of the past, would have been capable of advancing thus far on the road leading to its <mark class="term unknown">world-wide</mark> recognition and triumph. Little did he
    imagine that less than forty years after the death of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> His Cause, bursting beyond the confines of Persia and the East, would have penetrated the
    furthermost regions of the globe and would have encircled the whole earth. Scarcely would he have believed the prediction had he been told that the Cause
    would, within that period, have implanted its banner in the heart of the American continent, would have made itself felt in the leading capitals of Europe,
    would have reached out to the southern confines of Africa, and would <a name="Page_665"></a>have established its outposts as far as Australasia. Hardly
    would his imagination, fired as it was by a conviction as to the destiny of his Faith, have carried him to a point at which he could have pictured to his
    mind the Tomb Shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, of the ultimate destination of whose remains he confesses himself to be ignorant, embosomed in the heart of Carmel, a
    place of pilgrimage and a beacon of light to many a visitor from the ends of the earth. Hardly could he have imagined that the humble dwelling of
    <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, lost amid the tortuous lanes of old <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>, would one day, as a result of the machinations of a tireless enemy, have forced itself on
    the attention, and become the object of the earnest deliberations, of the assembled representatives of the leading Powers of Europe. Little did he imagine
that, with all the praise he, in his narrative, lavishes upon Him, there would proceed from the Most Great Branch    <a href="#_ftn659" name="_ftnref659" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡]</a> a power that within a short period would have awakened the northern States of the American
    continent to the glory of the Revelation bequeathed to Him by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>. Little did he imagine that the dynasties of those monarchs the evidences of
    whose tyranny he recounts so vividly in his narrative, would have tottered to their fall and suffered the very fate which their representatives had so
    desperately striven to inflict upon their dreaded opponents. Little did he imagine that the whole ecclesiastical hierarchy of his country, the prime mover
    and the willing instrument of the abominations heaped upon his Faith, would so swiftly and easily be overthrown by the very forces <a name="Page_666"></a>it had attempted to subdue. Never would he have believed that the highest institutions of <mark class="term correct">sunní</mark><mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, the Sultanate and the Caliphate,    <a href="#_ftn660" name="_ftnref660" title="">[§§§§§]</a> those twin oppressors of the Faith of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, would have been swept away so ruthlessly by
    the very hands of the professing adherents of the Faith of <a name="Page_667"></a><mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. Little did he imagine that side by side with the steady expansion
    of the Cause of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> the forces of consolidation and internal administration would so progress as to present to the world the unique spectacle of a
    Commonwealth of peoples, <mark class="term unknown">world-wide</mark> in its ramifications, united in its purpose, <mark class="term unknown">co-ordinated</mark> in its efforts, and fired by a zeal and enthusiasm that no
    amount of adversity can quench.
<p></p>And yet who knows what achievements, greater than any that the past and the present have witnessed, may not still be in store for those into whose hands so
    precious a heritage has been entrusted? Who knows but that out of the turmoil which agitates the face of <mark class="term unknown">present-day</mark> society there may not emerge, sooner
    than we expect, the <mark class="term unknown">World-Order</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, the bare outline of which is being but faintly discerned among the <mark class="term unknown">world-wide</mark> communities that bear His
    name? For, great and marvellous as have been the achievements of the past, the glory of the golden age of the Cause, whose promise lies embedded within the
    shell of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s immortal utterance, is yet to be revealed. Fierce as may seem the onslaught of the forces of darkness that may still afflict this
    Cause, desperate and prolonged as may be that struggle, severe as may be the disappointments it may still experience, the ascendancy it will eventually
    obtain will be such as no other Faith has ever in its history achieved. The welding of the communities of East and West into the <mark class="term unknown">world-wide</mark> Brotherhood of
    which poets and dreamers have sung, and the promise of which lies at the very core of the Revelation conceived by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>; the recognition of His law
    as the indissoluble bond uniting the peoples and nations of the earth; and the proclamation of the reign of the Most Great Peace, are but a few among the
    chapters of the glorious tale which the consummation of the Faith of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> will unfold.
<p></p>Who knows but that triumphs, unsurpassed in splendour, are not in store for the mass of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>’s toiling followers? Surely, we stand too near the
    colossal edifice His hand has reared to be able, at the present stage of the evolution of His Revelation, to claim to be able even to conceive the full
    measure of its promised glory. Its past history, stained by the blood of countless martyrs, may well inspire us with the <a name="Page_668"></a>thought
    that, whatever may yet befall this Cause, however formidable the forces that may still assail it, however numerous the reverses it will inevitably suffer,
    its onward march can never be stayed, and that it will continue to advance until the very last promise, enshrined within the words of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>, shall
    have been completely redeemed. <a name="Page_669"></a>APPENDIX: LIST OF THE <mark class="term correct">BÁB</mark>’S <mark class="term unknown">BEST-KNOWN</mark> WORKS1. The Persian <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark><p></p><p>2. The Arabie <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark>

</p><h4>ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISIONS OF PERSIA IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
</h4>“There is no fixed principle or permanence in the administrative subdivisions of Persia. Their separation or combination is regulated by the ability or
    reputation of their governors, and by the scope that may be conceded thereto by the confidence or the fears of the sovereign.... It should further be
    remarked that no principle, geographical, ethnographical, or political, appears to be adopted in determining the borders and sizes of the various
    divisions, which vary in extent from a province larger than the whole of England, to a small and decayed town with its immediate surroundings.”

            blessing of God rest! His Holiness put in his mouth his blessed tongue. From the adorable saliva of His Holiness he drew forth the sciences and the

            acquired. To develop this doctrine, he used to apply cabalistic methods of interpretation to the sacred text, And exerted himself to acquire
            familiarity with the various sciences known to the Muslim world. He entertained the most exaggerated veneration for the <mark class="term correct">Imáms</mark>, especially the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark>

            he held views which were generally considered to be heterodox, as previously mentioned. He declared that the body of man was composed of different
            portions, derived from each of the four elements and the nine heavens, and that the body wherewith he was raised in the resurrection contained only
            the latter components, the former returning at death to their original sources. This subtle body, which alone escaped destruction, he called
            <mark class="term unknown">Jism-i-Huriqliya</mark>, the latter being supposed to be a Greek word. He asserted that it existed potentially in our present bodies, <mark class="term unknown">‘like</mark> glass in

            performed the journey. On account of these views, he was pronounced unorthodox by the majority of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark>, and accused of holding the doctrines
            of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Sadrá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣadrá</mark>, the greatest Persian philosopher of modern times.” (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1889, article 12, pp. 890–91.)

        <p></p>A. L. M. Nicolas quotes in Chapter 3 of his “Essai sur le <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>isme,” II, p. 43, the following extract from the <u>Sh</u>
            <mark class="term unknown">arh-i-Qasidih</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>: “I have announced that every hundred years there are a chosen few who spread and sow the precepts which explain that
            which is lawful and that which is unlawful; who tell of the things that were hidden during the hundred preceding years. In other words, in every
            century a learned and perfect man is found who causes the tree of religious law to revive and bloom; who regenerates its trunk to such an extent
            that at last the book of Creation comes to its end in a period of twelve hundred years. At that moment, a certain number of perfect men will appear
            who will reveal certain very intimate things which were hidden.... Therefore, when the twelve hundred years will have been completed, when the
            first cycle is ended, which depended upon the appearance of the Sun of the Prophet and of the Moon of the Vilayat, then the influence of that cycle
            is ended and a second cycle begins in which the intimate precepts and hidden meanings of the former cycle are explained.” He himself then adds
            these words: “In other words, and in order to render clearer this amazing statement which truly needs no interpretation, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> tells us that
            the first cycle which lasts twelve hundred years is solely for the education of the bodies and of the spirits which are dependent upon them. It is
            like a child in the womb of the mother. The second cycle is for the education of the pure spirits, the souls which have no relation to the world of
            matter. It is as though God wished to elevate the spirit by means of the performance of its duty in this world. Therefore, when the first cycle is
            completed, the glory of which is the name of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, comes the cycle of the education of the intimates. In this cycle the appearances obey the
            intimates, just as in the preceding cycle the heavenly name of the Prophet, which is <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, is the place of the appearance, the Master: <mark class="term unknown">‘But</mark> this
            name must necessarily be found to be of the fruit of the best soil and of the purest air.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” Nicolas further adds in a footnote the following words:
            “The name of <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> mentioned above would lead one to believe that it refers to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, but one cannot say, however, in speaking
            of Lahca, that it is the best of lands, or of the purest air. We know, on the contrary, that all the Persian poets sing the praises of <u>Sh</u>
            <mark class="term unknown">íráz</mark> and of its ideal climate. It is only necessary to see what <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> himself said of his country.”

            “You have understood, I think, that the religious law and the precepts of morality are the food of the Spirit. It is then necessary that these

            things which are doubtful and some things which are certain; some things general and some things specific; some things absolute and some things
            finite; some of appearances and some of inner realities, so that the child may reach adolescence and may be perfect in his power and his capacity.

            <mark class="term unknown">íráz</mark>, long before the date ofthe latter’s Manifestation. He saw Him on several occasions which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was only eight or nine years old, in the
            house of His maternal uncle. He subsequently met Him in <mark class="term correct">Bú<u>sh</u>ihr</mark> and stayed for about six months in the same <mark class="term correct"><u>kh</u>án</mark> in which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and
            His maternal uncle were residing. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">‘Alíy-i-Bastamí</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Alíy-i-Basṭámí</mark>, one of the Letters of the Living, acquainted him with the Message of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, while in
            <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, from which city he proceeded to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> in order to inform himself more fully of the nature of His Revelation.” (Pp- 55–7.)
        <p></p>“[The] <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> possessed a mild and benignant countenance, his manners were composed and dignified, his eloquence was impressive, and he wrote rapidly
            and well.” (Lady Sheil’s “Glimpses of Life and Manners in Persia,” p. 178.)

            “Withdrawn within himself, always absorbed in pious practices, of extreme simplicity of manner, of a fascinating gentleness, those gifts further
            heightened by his great youth and his marvellous charm, he drew about himself a number of persons who were deeply edified. People then began to
            speak of his science and of the penetrating eloquence of his discourses. He could not open his lips (we are assured by those who knew him) without
            stirring the hearts to their very depths.
        <p></p>“Speaking, moreover, with a profound reverence regarding the Prophet, the <mark class="term correct">Imáms</mark> and their holy companions, he fascinated the severely orthodox
            while, at the same time, in more intimate addresses, the more ardent and eager minds were happy to find that there was no rigidity in his
            profession of traditional opinions which they would have found boring. His conversations, on the contrary, opened before them unlimited horizons,
            varied, colored, mysterious, with shadows broken here and there by patches of blinding light which transported those imaginative people of Persia
            into a state of ecstasy.” (Comte de Gobineau’s “Les Religions et les Philosophies dans <mark class="term unknown">l’Asie</mark> Centrale,” p. 118.)

            According to the “Memorials of the Faithful” (pp. 291–8), <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> had two sons and one daughter, none of whom recognised the truth of the Cause.
            Such was the degree of her knowledge and attainment, that her father, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ṣáliḥ</mark> often expressed his regret in the following terms: “Would
            that she had been a boy for he would have shed illumination upon my household, and would have succeeded me!” She became acquainted with the
            writings of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> while staying in the home of her cousin, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Javád</mark>, from whose library she borrowed these books, and took
            them over to her home. Her father raised violent objections to her action and, in his heated discussions with her, denounced and criticised the
            teachings of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>. <mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark> refused to heed the counsels of her father, and engaged in secret correspondence with <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>
<mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, who conferred upon her the name of “<mark class="term correct">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark>.” The title of “<mark class="term misspelled">Táhirih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭáhirih</mark>” was first associated with her name while she was staying in Bada            <u>sh</u>t, and was subsequently approved by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. From <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> she left for <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>, hoping to meet <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark>, but arrived too late, the
            <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> having passed away ten days before her arrival. She joined the companions of the departed leader, and spent her time in prayer and
            meditation, eagerly expecting the appearance of Him whose advent <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Kázim</mark> <mark class="term correction">Káẓim</mark> had foretold. While in that city, she dreamed a dream. A youth, a
            <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>, wearing a black cloak and a green turban, appeared to her in the heavens, who with upraised hands was reciting certain verses, one of which
            she noted down in her book. She awoke from her dream greatly impressed by her strange experience. When, later on, a copy of the “<mark class="term misspelled">Ahsánu’l-Qisás</mark> <mark class="term correction">Aḥsanu’l-Qiṣaṣ</mark>,”
            the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s commentary on the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of Joseph, reached her, she, to her intense delight, discovered that same verse which she had heard in her dream
            in that book. That discovery assured her of the truth of the Message which the Author of that work had proclaimed. She herself undertook the
            translation of the “<mark class="term misspelled">Ahsánu’l-Qisás</mark> <mark class="term correction">Aḥsanu’l-Qiṣaṣ</mark>” into Persian, and exerted the utmost effort for its spread and interpretation. For three months her house in
            <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> was besieged by the guards whom the Governor had appointed to watch and prevent her from associating with the people. From <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> she
            proceeded to <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark>, and lived for a time the house of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-i-<u>Sh</u>ibl</mark>, from which place she transferred her
            residence to another quarter, and was eventually taken to the home of the <mark class="term correct">Muftí</mark>, where she stayed for about three months.

            direct question put to him. However, this did not prevent the questioner from spreading abroad in the city the news that <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> himself
            acknowledged <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> as a Master whom he had declared <mark class="term correct">Mujtahid</mark> in his presence.
        <p></p>“Now <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> had gone to live with one of his colleagues, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>. The latter learned quickly of the news which was thus
            noised abroad and he immediately summoned before him the questioner of the <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> whom he reproached severely in the presence of witnesses.
            Naturally, the rumor spread from tongue to tongue until it reached <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, who became furious and declared each time he heard the name of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark>
            <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>,—<mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> only respect him because he is the son of my blessed Master.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
        <p></p>“<mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, having been informed of all these incidents and of all the rumors, and realizing that he had saddened the heart of <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, came one
            day to invite him to luncheon; he treated him with great respect, wrote for him his brevet of <mark class="term correct">Mujtahid</mark> and, this same day, accompanied him to the
            Mosque. The prayer over, he sat down on the steps of the pulpit where he spoke the praises of <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> and confirmed him in his new dignity, in the
            presence of the entire assembly. It happened that, a little later, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aḥmad-i-Ahsá’í</mark> <mark class="term correction">Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í</mark> passed through <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>.

            everyone knows that in most cases to try to blend religious law with intelligence is an impossibility.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Be that as it may, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark>
            <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> rose high above his contemporaries, many men sharing his opinions. He had followers in all the cities of Persia and the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> <mark class="term correct">Fatḥ-‘Alí</mark>
            treated him with great deference, while <mark class="term misspelled">A<u>kh</u>und</mark> <mark class="term correction">Á<u>kh</u>únd</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> said of him, <mark class="term unknown">‘He</mark> is an ignorant man with a pure heart.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
        <p></p>“While in <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, he sojourned in the house of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark> who was henceforth to be the enemy of the <mark class="term unknown">Baraqání</mark> family. He went to worship
            in the Mosque of the parish and the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> came to pray under his guidance. He naturally returned all the visits and courtesies extended
            to him by these holy men, was on good terms with them and soon it became known that his host was one of his disciples. One day he went to call upon
            <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term unknown">Taqí-i-Baraqání</mark> who received him apparently with profound respect, but took advantage of the opportunity to ask him some insidious
questions. <mark class="term unknown">‘Regarding</mark> the resurrection of the dead on the Day of Judgment,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> he asked, <mark class="term unknown">‘do</mark> you share the opinion of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Sadrá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣadrá</mark>?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> <mark class="term unknown">‘No</mark>,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> replied            <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>. Then <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>, calling his youngest brother <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, said: <mark class="term unknown">‘Go</mark> to my library and bring me the <u>Sh</u>
            <mark class="term unknown">avahid-i-Rububíyyih</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Sadrá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣadrá</mark>.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Then, as <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> was slow to return, he said to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>: <mark class="term unknown">‘Although</mark> I do not agree with
            you on this subject, I am nevertheless curious to know your opinion on the matter.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> replied, <mark class="term unknown">‘Nothing</mark> would be easier. My
            conviction is that the resurrection will not take place with our material bodies but with their essence, and by essence I mean, for example, the
            glass which is potentially in the stone.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
        <p></p>“Excuse me,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> replied maliciously, <mark class="term unknown">‘but</mark> this essence is different from the material body and you know that it is a dogma in our holy religion
            to believe in the resurrection of the material body.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> remained silent and it was in vain that one of his pupils, a native
of <mark class="term unknown">Turkistán</mark>, endeavored to divert the conversation by starting a discussion which was likely to be a lengthy one, but the blow was dealt and            <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> withdrew, convinced that he had been compromised. It was not long before he realized that his conversation had been
            carefully related by <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> for, that very day, when he went to the Mosque to pray he was followed only by <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>. A misunderstanding was
            broiling and threatened to break, but <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>, thinking he had found a way to smooth things over and remove all the difficulties, entreated
            his Master to write and publish a book in which he would affirm the resurrection of the material body. But he had not taken into account the hatred
            of <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>. In fact, <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> did write the treatise, which still may be found in his book entitled ‘<mark class="term misspelled">Ajvibatu’l-Masa’il</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ajvibatu’l-Masá’il</mark>’ but no one
            cared to read it and his impiety was noised abroad increasingly from day to day. It came to the point where the Governor of the city, Prince
            <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Naqí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ruknu’d-Dawlih</mark>, considering the importance of the personages involved in the controversy and afraid being blamed for allowing this
            dissension to grow, resolved to bring about an agreement.
        <p></p>“One night, he invited all the celebrated <mark class="term unknown">‘Ulamás</mark> of the city to a great banquet. <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark> was given the seat of honor and close
            to him, only separated by one person, was <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark>. Platters were brought, prepared for three people, so that the two enemies found that they were
            obliged to eat together, but the irreconcilable <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> turned toward the platter of his neighbors on his right hand and to the great consternation of
            the Prince, he placed his left hand over the left side of his face in such a manner that he could not possibly see <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>.
After the banquet which proved rather dull, the Prince, still determined to reconcile the two adversaries, bestowed great praise on <u>Sh</u>ay            <u>kh</u> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, acknowledging him as the great Arabian and Persian Doctor and saying that <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> should show him the greatest respect; that it was
            not proper for him to give ear to the gossip of men eager to create conflict between two exceptional minds. <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> interrupted him violently and
            declared with great contempt, <mark class="term unknown">‘There</mark> can be no peace between impiety and faith! Concerning the resurrection the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> holds a
            doctrine opposed to the religion of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, (<mark class="term correct">Islámic</mark> law) therefore, whoever holds such a doctrine is an impious one and what can such a rebel and I

            “<mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ṣáliḥ</mark> had among his children a daughter, <mark class="term unknown">Zarrín-Táj</mark> (Crown of Gold), who had attracted attention from early childhood. Instead of taking
            part in games and amusements like her companions, she passed hours at a time listening to her parents discuss religious matters. Her keen
            intelligence quickly perceived the fallacies of <mark class="term correct">Islámic</mark> science without succumbing to it and soon she was able to discuss points which were most
            obscure and confusing. The <mark class="term unknown">Hadí<u>th</u>s</mark> (traditions) held no secrets for her. Her reputation soon became widely known in the city and her
            <mark class="term unknown">fellow-citizens</mark> considered her a prodigy, and justly so. A prodigy in science, also a prodigy of beauty, for the child, as she grew to girlhood,
            possessed a face which shone with such radiant beauty that they named her ‘<mark class="term misspelled">Qurratu’l-’Ayn</mark> <mark class="term correction">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark>’, which M. de Gobineau translates as <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> Consolation of

            he remained, at least in appearance, a <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadan</mark>: <mark class="term unknown">‘None</mark> of us, her brothers or her cousins dared to speak in her presence, her learning so
            intimidated us, and if we ventured to express some hypothesis upon a disputed point of doctrine, she demonstrated in such a clear, precise and
            conclusive manner that we were going astray, that we instantly withdrew confused.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
        <p></p>“She was present at her father’s and uncle’s classes, in the same room with two or three hundred students, but always concealed behind a curtain,
            and more than once she refuted the explanation that these two elderly men offered upon such and such a question. Her reputation became universal
            throughout all Persia, and the most haughty <mark class="term unknown">‘Ulamás</mark> consented to adopt some of her hypotheses and opinions. This fact is all the more extraordinary
            because the <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>í’ite</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadan</mark> religion relegates the woman almost to the level of the animal. They consider that she has no soul and exists

        <p></p>A. L. M. Nicolas, in his introduction to volume I of “Le <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark> Persan” (pp. 3–5), writes as follows: “Everyone agrees in acknowledging that it
            would be absolutely impossible for him to proclaim loudly his doctrine or to spread it among men. He had to act as does a physician to children,
            who must disguise a bitter medicine in a sweet coating in order to win over his young patients. The people in the midst of whom he appeared were,
            and still are, alas, more fanatical than the Jews were at the time of Jesus, when the majesty of Roman peace was no longer there to put a stop to
            the furious excesses of religious madness of an <mark class="term unknown">over-excited</mark> people. Therefore, if Christ, in spite of the relative calm of the surroundings in
            which He preached, thought it necessary to employ the parable, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark>, a fortiori, was obliged to disguise his thought in numerous
            circuitous ways and only pour out, one drop at a time, the filter of his divine truths. He brings up his child, Humanity; he guides it, endeavoring
            always not to frighten it and directs its first steps on a path which leads it slowly but surely, so that, as soon as it can proceed alone, it
            reaches the goal <mark class="term unknown">pre-ordained</mark> for it from all eternity.”

            “Be that as it may, the resultant impression was immense in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> and all the learned and religious gathered around <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark>. As soon
            as he appeared in the Mosque, they surrounded him and, as soon as he was seated in the pulpit, everyone was silent in order to listen to him. His
            public talks never attacked the essentials of the Faith of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, they respected most of its ritual; in fact, the Kitman dominated. Nevertheless,
            they were daring discourses. The clergy was not spared; its vices were cruelly lashed. The sad and painful destiny of humanity was generally the
            theme. Here and there, certain allusions, the obscurity of which irritated the passions of some while it flattered the pride of others already
            initiated as a whole or only in part, gave to his prophecies such a bitter truth that the crowd was growing day by day and so, in all Persia, they
            were beginning to talk of <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark>.
        <p></p>“The <mark class="term unknown">Mullás</mark> of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> had not waited for all this agitation to unite against this young detractor. From his first public appearances, they
            sent to him their most able <mark class="term unknown">Mullás</mark> to argue with him and confuse him, and these public debates were held either in the Mosques or in the colleges
            in the presence of the Governor, the military chiefs, the clergy, the people, in fact before everyone. But, instead of benefiting the clergy, they
            contributed quite a little to spread and exalt, at their own expense, the renown of this enthusiastic teacher. It is a fact that he defeated his
            adversaries, he condemned them—which was not very difficult—with the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> in hand. It was an easy matter for him to show before all these crowds
            who knew the <mark class="term unknown">Mullás</mark> well, at which point their conduct, their precepts, and to what extent their beliefs, even their theology, were in flagrant
            contradiction with the Book, which they could not deny.
        <p></p>“Possessed of extraordinary daring and exaltation, he flayed unsparingly the vices of his antagonists, disregarding all ordinary conventions. After
            having proven their infidelity to their own doctrine, he shamed them in their lives and threw them at pitch and toss to the indignation or the
            contempt of the auditors.
        <p></p>“At <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, his first appearances, when he preached, were so profoundly moving that even the orthodox <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadans</mark> who were present have
            retained an indelible memory of them and never recall them without a sort of terror. They agreed unanimously that the eloquence of <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark>
            was of an incomparable kind, such that, without having been an <mark class="term unknown">eye-witness</mark>, one could not possibly imagine. Soon the young theologian no longer
            appeared in public without being surrounded with many partisans. His house was always filled with them and he not only taught in the Mosques and in
            the colleges, but it was principally at his house and in the evenings that, withdrawn in a room with the elite of his admirers, he lifted for them
            the veils of a doctrine which even for himself he had not yet fully established.
        <p></p>“It seemed in these early days that he was occupied with polemics rather than with dogmatic statements and nothing is more natural. In these secret
            talks, his bold declarations which were much more frequent than in the public addresses, grew each day and tended so clearly to a complete
            overthrow of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> that they were a prelude to a new profession of Faith. The little congregation was ardent, brave, carried away, ready for
            anything; they were fanatical in the true and noble sense of the word, that is to say, that every one of its members thought himself of no
            importance and burned with a desire to sacrifice his <mark class="term unknown">life-blood</mark> and his belongings for the cause of Truth.” (Comte de Gobineau’s “Les Religions et
            les Philosophies dans <mark class="term unknown">l’Asie</mark> Centrale,” pp. 120, 122.)
        <p></p>“These ethics taught by a young man at an age when passions were intense, deeply impressed an audience, religious to the point of fanaticism, above
            all when the words of the preacher were in perfect harmony with his conduct. No one doubted the continence and the firmness of <mark class="term correct">Karbilá’í</mark> <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>
            <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark>; he spoke little, meditated constantly and most of the time fled from the presence of men, which all the more aroused their
            curiosity. He was sought after everywhere.” (Journal Asiatique, 1866, tome 7, p. 341.)
        <p></p>“By the uprightness of his life the young <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> served as an example to those about him. He was willingly listened to when, in his ambiguous and
            interrupted talks, he condemned the abuses evident in all classes of society. His words were repeated and elaborated upon and they spoke of him as
            the true Master and gave themselves to him unreservedly.” (Ibid.)

            and erudition were widely and fully recognized.” (From manuscript relating to martyrdoms in Persia.)
        <p></p>“This personage was, as his name indicates, born at <mark class="term unknown">Daráb</mark> near <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>; his father, <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ja‘far</mark>, surnamed <mark class="term correct">Ka<u>sh</u>fí</mark>, was one of the

        <p></p>“While these events were taking place in the north of Persia, the central and southern provinces were deeply roused by the fiery eloquence of the
            missionaries of the new doctrine. The people, light, credulous, ignorant, superstitious in the extreme, were struck dumb by the incessant miracles
            which they heard related every moment; the anxious priests, feeling their flock quivering with impatience and ready to escape their control,
            redoubled their slanders and infamous imputations; the grossest lies, the most bloody fictions were spread among the bewildered populace, torn
            between horror and admiration.... <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ja‘far</mark> was unacquainted with the doctrine of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ís</mark> as he was with those of <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark>
<mark class="term misspelled">Sadrá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣadrá</mark>. Nevertheless, his burning zeal and his ardent imagination had carried him, towards the end of his life, out of the ways of the orthodox            <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>í’ite</mark>. He interpreted the ‘<mark class="term unknown">hadí<u>th</u>s</mark>’ differently from his colleagues and claimed even, so they said, to have fathomed the seventy

            was upon him that the choice of His Majesty fell. He was, therefore, commissioned to go to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> to make contact with the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and to inform
            the central authority, as exactly as possible, of the political consequences which would result from a reform which seemed likely unsettle heart of

            verses in that commentary.
        <p></p>“Within five <mark class="term unknown">hours’</mark> time he revealed two thousand verses, that is, he spoke as fast as the scribe could write. One can judge thereby that, if he

        <p></p>“God had given him such power and such fluency of expression that, if a scribe wrote with the most extreme rapidity during two days and two nights

            but that which surprised him even more was to find, in this commentary, the explanation that he, himself, had found in his meditation on these

            “<mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>,” writes Gobineau, “was a prince of peculiar temperament, a type often seen in Asia but not often discovered or understood by
            Europeans. Although he reigned during a period when political practices were rather harsh, he was kind and patient and his tolerance extended even
            to the discords of his harem which were of such a nature as normally to cause grave annoyance; for, even in the days of <mark class="term correct">Fatḥ-‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, the
            <mark class="term unknown">laisser-aller</mark>, the whims and fancies were never carried to such an extreme. The following words which our 18th century might recognize as its own
            are attributed to him: <mark class="term unknown">‘Why</mark> are you not more discreet, Madam? I do not wish to hinder you from enjoying yourself.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
        <p></p>“But, in his case, it was not affected indifference, but fatigue and boredom. His health had always been wretched; seriously ill with gout, he was
            hardly ever free from pain. His disposition naturally weak, had become very melancholy and, as he craved love and could not find it in his family
            either with his wives or children, he had centered all his affection upon the aged <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark>, his tutor. He had made of him his only friend, his
            confidant, then his first and <mark class="term unknown">all-powerful</mark> minister, even his god! Brought up by this idol with very irreverent sentiments toward <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, he was
            equally as indifferent toward the dogmas of the Prophet as toward the Prophet himself. He cared little for the <mark class="term correct">Imáms</mark> and, if he had any regard for
            <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark>, it is because the Persian mind is wont to identify this venerable personage with the nation itself.
        <p></p>“But in brief, <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> was no better <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadan</mark> than he was Christian or Jew. He believed that the Divine Essence incarnates Itself in
            the Sages with all Its power, and, as he considered <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark> a Sage par excellence, he felt certain that he was God and he would piously
            ask him to perform miracles. Often he said to his officers with earnestness and conviction, <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> has promised me a miracle for tonight, you
            shall see!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> As long as the character of the <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> was not involved, <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> was completely indifferent regarding the success or failure
            of this or that religious doctrine; he was rather pleased to witness the conflict of opinions which were proof to him of the universal blindness.”

            According to “A Traveller’s Narrative” (p. 14), the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> “forwarded a letter to the Royal Presence craving audience to set forth the truth of His
            condition, expecting this to be a means for the attainment of great advantages.” Regarding this letter, Gobineau writes as follows: “<mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark>
            wrote personally to the Court and his letter and the accusations of his adversaries all arrived at the same time. Without assuming an aggressive
            attitude toward the king, but trusting on the contrary to his authority and justice, he represented to them that the depravity of the clergy in
            Persia had been well known for many years; that not only morals were thereby corrupted and the <mark class="term unknown">well-being</mark> of the nation affected, but that religion
            itself, poisoned by the sins of so many, was in great danger and was about to disappear leaving the people in perilous darkness.
        <p></p>“As for himself, called by God, in virtue of a special mission, to prevent such an evil, he had already begun to apprise the people of <mark class="term correct">Fárs</mark> that
            the true doctrine had made evident and rapid progress; that all its adversaries had been confounded and were now powerless and universally
            despised; but that this was only a beginning.
        <p></p>“The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, confident of the magnanimity of the king, requested the permission to come to the capital with his principal disciples and there hold
            conferences with all the <mark class="term unknown">Mullás</mark> of the Empire, in the presence of the Sovereign, the nobles and the people, convinced that he would shame them by
            exposing their faithlessness. He would accept beforehand the judgment of the king and, in case of failure, was ready to sacrifice his head and that
            of each one of his followers.” (Comte de Gobineau’s “Les Religions et les Philosophies dans <mark class="term unknown">l’Asie</mark> Centrale,” p. 124.)

            woman brought a <mark class="term unknown">scald-headed</mark> child, whose head was so covered with scabs that it was white down to the neck, and entreated His Holiness to heal
            him. The guards would have forbidden her but His Holiness prevented them, and called the child to Him. Then He drew a handkerchief over its head
            and repeated certain words; which he had no sooner done than the child was healed. And in that place about two hundred persons believed and
            underwent a true and sincere conversion.” (Pp. 222–21.)

            wisdom. There is no sin which has not brought me affliction. When I learned of your command (to take me to <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>) I wrote to <mark class="term unknown">Sadr-i-‘Aẓam</mark>: “Kill
            me and send my head wherever you please, because to live without sin among sinners does not please me.” He did not reply and I am convinced that he
            did not understand the matter, because to sadden without reason the hearts of the believers is worse than to destroy the very house of God; but I
            declare that it is I who am today the house of God! Reward comes to him who is good to me; it is as though he were good to God, to His angels and
            to His saints. But perhaps God and His saints are too high above us for the good or evil of men to reach their threshold, but what happens to God,
            happens to me. I declare before God that he who has imprisoned me has imprisoned himself; only that which is the will of God can happen to me. Woe
            to him whose hand works evil! Blessed is he who scatters good!
        <p></p>“<mark class="term unknown">‘At</mark> last, to sum up this letter already too long: The late <mark class="term misspelled">Mu’tamíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Mu‘tamid</mark>, one night, dismissed all his guests to retire, even <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Aḥmad</mark>, and
            then he said to me: “I know very well that all I have acquired has been obtained through force and all that I have belongs to the <mark class="term misspelled">Sáhibu’z-Zamán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṣáḥibu’z-Zamán</mark>. I
            therefore give it all to thee, thou art the Master of Truth and I ask of thee the privilege of ownership.” He even took the ring off his finger and
            gave it to me. I took it and gave it back to him and I sent him away in possession of all his goods. God is witness of the truth of this testimony.
            I do not wish for a dinar of his wealth, that is for you to dispose of; but as, in any dispute, God requires the testimony of two witnesses, from
            the midst of all the learned, call <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">Yaḥyá</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled">A<u>kh</u>und</mark> <mark class="term correction">Á<u>kh</u>únd</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">‘Abdu’l-<u>Kh</u>aliq</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Abdu’l-<u>Kh</u>áliq</mark>.

            the truth of my testimony will appear.

        <p></p>“The letter ends with cabalistic proofs and some <mark class="term unknown">hadí<u>th</u>s</mark>. It is clear therefore that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was very unhappy in his prison. He evidently
            remained there a long time, as the document which we have quoted dates back to 1264, and the execution of the martyr took place only on the
            <mark class="term unknown">twenty-seventh</mark> of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>a’bán</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>a‘bán</mark> of the year 1266 (July 8, 1850).” (A.

        <p></p>This is the prayer which the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> Himself quotes in the “<mark class="term correct">Dalá’il-i-Sab‘ih</mark>” as His supplication during the months of His captivity in the castle of
            <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>:
        <p></p>“O my God! Grant to him, to his descendants, to his family, to his friends, to his subjects, to his relatives and all the inhabitants of the earth
            the light which will clarify their vision and facilitate their task; grant that they may partake of the noblest works here and hereafter!
        <p></p>“In truth, nothing is impossible to Thee.
        <p></p>“O my God! give him the power to bring about a revival of Thy religion and give life by him to what Thou hast changed in Thy Book. Manifest through
            him Thy new commandments so that through him Thy religion may blossom again! Put into his hands a new Book, pure and holy, that this Book may be
            free from all doubt and uncertainty and that no one may be able to alter or destroy it.
        <p></p>“O my God! Dispel through Thy splendor all darkness and through his evident power do away with the antiquated laws. By his preeminence ruin those
            who have not followed the ways of God. Through him destroy all tyrants, put an end, through his sword, to all discord; annihilate, through his
            justice, all forms of oppression; render the rulers obedient to his commandments; subordinate all the empires of the world to his empire!
        <p></p>“O my God! Humble everyone who desires to humble him; destroy all his enemies; deny anyone who denies him and confuse anyone who spurns the truth,
            resists his orders, endeavors to darken his light and blot his name!”
        <p></p>The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> then adds these words:
        <p></p>“Repeat these benedictions often and, if time to recite them all be lacking, do not fail to say at least the last. Be awake on the day of the
            apparition of Him whom God will manifest because this prayer has come down from heaven for Him, although I hope no sorrow awaits Him; I have taught
            the believers in my religion never to rejoice over the misfortune of anyone. It is possible therefore that at the time of the appearance of the Sun
            of Truth no suffering may fall upon Him.” (“Le Livre des Sept Preuves,” translation of A. L. M. Nicolas, pp. 64–65.)

            “During his sojourn in <mark class="term correct">Máh-Kú</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> composed a great number of works amongst the most important of which may be especially mentioned the Persian
            <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark> and the Seven Proofs, (<mark class="term correct">Dalá’il-i-Sab‘ih</mark>) both of which contain ample internal evidence of having been written at this period. Indeed, if we
            may credit a statement made in the <mark class="term misspelled">Tarí<u>kh</u>-i-Jadíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Tárí<u>kh</u>-i-Jadíd</mark>, on the authority of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Vahháb</mark>, the various writings of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, current in
            <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark> alone, amounted in all to not less than a million verses!” (“A Traveller’s Narrative” Note L, p. 200.)
        <p></p>Regarding the “<mark class="term correct">Dalá’il-i-Sab‘ih</mark>,” Nicolas writes as follows: “<mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> Book of Seven <mark class="term unknown">Proofs’</mark> is the most important of the polemical works from the pen
            of <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark>, dit le <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>.” (Preface, page 1.)
        <p></p>“His correspondent evidently asked him for the proofs of his mission and his answer is admirable for its precision and clearness. It rests upon two
            verses of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark>; according to the first, no one can reveal verses even though assisted by the entire world of men and evil spirits; according
            to the second, no one can understand the meaning of the verses of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> except God, and men of solid learning.” (Preface, p. 5.)
        <p></p>“Clearly the arguments of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> are new and original and one can see, by this brief reference, of what profound interest must be his literary
            work. The scope of my work does not permit me to expound, even briefly, the principal dogmas of a bold doctrine the form of which is both brilliant
            and attractive. I hope to do so in the future but I wish to make another comment upon the <mark class="term unknown">‘Book</mark> of the Seven <mark class="term unknown">Proofs’</mark>: toward the end of his book,
            the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> speaks of the miracles which have accompanied his manifestation. This will probably astonish the readers, as we have seen the new apostle
            deny clearly the truth of the physical miracles which the <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadan</mark> imagination attributes to <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>. He affirms that, for himself as well as
            for the Arabian Prophet, the only proof of his mission was the outpouring of the verses. He offers no other proof, not because he is unable to
            perform miracles, (God being <mark class="term unknown">all-powerful</mark>) but simply because physical marvels are of inferior order in comparison with spiritual miracles.”

        <p></p>“The province had been for some years the scene of serious uprisings. At the end of 1844 or at the beginning of 1845, the governor of <mark class="term misspelled">Bujnurd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Bujnúrd</mark> had
            revolted against the authority of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> and had made an alliance with the Turkomans against Persia. The Prince <mark class="term misspelled">Asifu’d-Dawlih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áṣifu’d-Dawlih</mark>, governor
            of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, asked the capital for assistance. The general <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> <mark class="term correct">Bábá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, <mark class="term unknown">commander-in-chief</mark> of the Persian army, was ordered
            to send a thousand men against the rebels but the scarcity of public funds prevented the expedition. The <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, therefore, planned to head
            personally a campaign in the spring. The preparations began immediately. Soon ten battalions, of one thousand men each, were ready awaiting the
            arrival of Prince <mark class="term correct">Ḥamzih</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, appointed <mark class="term unknown">general-in-chief</mark> of the expedition. All of a sudden, the governor of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Asifu’d-Dawlih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áṣifu’d-Dawlih</mark>,
            brother of the King’s mother, feeling that his security was threatened by the suspicions of the authorities at <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, arrived at the Court humbly
            to protest at the feet of the King and to assure him of his complete devotion, and demand that his defamers be punished.
        <p></p>“It so happened that the principal one among his adversaries was <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Aqásí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áqásí</mark>, the <mark class="term unknown">all-powerful</mark> prime minister. A long trial took place which
            ended with the defeat of the governor and he was ordered to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca with the mother of the King.
        <p></p>“The son of <mark class="term misspelled">Asifu’d-Dawlih</mark> <mark class="term correction">Áṣifu’d-Dawlih</mark>, <mark class="term misspelled">Salar</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sálár</mark>, guardian of the mosque at <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>, wealthy in his own right, confident because of his alliance with the

Thereupon 3000 men and 12 pieces of
            artillery were sent in retaliation and the government of <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>urásán</mark> was given into the hands of <mark class="term correct">Ḥamzih</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>.
        <p></p>“The news that <mark class="term misspelled">Ja’far-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ja‘far-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, heading a large troop of cavalry, had attacked the royal expedition, caused five more regiments and

On the <mark class="term unknown">twenty-eighth</mark> of October, 1847, this uprising was completely crushed, through the victory of            <mark class="term unknown"><u>Sh</u>áh-rud</mark> (September 15) and the defeat and flight of <mark class="term unknown">Ja’far-Qulí-<u>Kh</u>án</mark> and of <mark class="term misspelled">Salar</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sálár</mark>.” (A.

            “<mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark> is the greatest place of pilgrimage in all Persia, <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> being, as everyone knows in Ottoman territory. It is in <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>
            that the holy shrine of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> <mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark> is located. I shall not enlarge upon the hundreds of miracles that have taken place and still take place at
            this shrine; it is enough to know that every year thousands of pilgrims visit the tomb and return home only after the shrewd exploiters of that
            productive business have separated them from their last penny. The stream of gold flows on and on for the benefit of the greedy officials; but
            these officials need the cooperation of many partners to catch their innumerable dupes in their nets. This is, without doubt, the best organized
            industry in Persia. If one half of the city derives its living from the Mosque, the other half is likewise keenly interested in the great concourse
            of pilgrims. The merchants, the restaurant and hotel keepers, even the young women who find among the visitors an abundant supply of <mark class="term unknown">‘husbands</mark> for
            a <mark class="term unknown">day’</mark>!
        <p></p>“All these people were naturally allied against a missionary whose teachings were threatening their livelihood. To denounce these abuses in any
            other city was tolerable but it was quite improper to denounce them where everyone of every class was thriving upon them. The <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark> had
            undoubtedly the right to come but he certainly was a public nuisance. It may have been very thrilling to undertake with him the conquest of the
            world, but there was fatigue, risk and danger in the enterprise while now they were enjoying perfect peace in a fine city where one could earn a
            living with ease and security.” (Ibid., pp. 258–259.)

            latter was to proclaim publicly the independent character of the Revelation of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and to emphasise the abrogation of the laws and ordinances
            of the previous Dispensation. <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, on the other hand, was expected to oppose her contention and strenuously to reject her views. This
            arrangement was made for the purpose of mitigating the effects of such a challenging and <mark class="term unknown">far-reaching</mark> proclamation, and of averting the dangers and
            perils which such a startling innovation was sure to produce. (P. 211.) <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> appears to have taken a neutral attitude in this controversy,
            though actually He was the prime mover and the controlling and directing influence throughout the different stages of that memorable episode.
        <p></p>“But the effect produced had been astounding! The assembly was as if struck by lightning. Some hid their faces with their hands, others, prostrated
            themselves, others covered their heads with their garments so that they could not see the features of her Highness, the Pure One. If it was a
            grievous sin to look upon the face of an unknown woman who might pass by, what a crime to let one’s eyes fall upon her who was so saintly! The
            meeting was broken up in the midst of an indescribable tumult. Insults fell upon her whom they thought so indecent as to appear thus with her face
            uncovered. Some armed that she had lost her mind, others that she was shameless, and some, very few, took up her defense.” (A. L. M. <mark class="term unknown">Nicolas’</mark>

            “It was this bold act of <mark class="term correct">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark> which shook the foundations of a literal belief in <mark class="term correct">Islámic</mark> doctrines among the Persians. It may be added
            that the <mark class="term unknown">first-fruits</mark> of <mark class="term unknown">qurratu’l-’Ayn</mark>’s teaching was no less than the heroic <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, and that the eloquent teacher herself owed her insight

        <p></p>“It has been suggested that the true cause of the summoning of that assembly was anxiety for the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and a desire to carry him off to a place of
            safety. But the more accepted view—that the subject before the Council was the relation of the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> to the <mark class="term correct">Islámic</mark> laws—is also the more
            probable.” (Ibid., p. 80.) “The object of the conference was to correct a widespread misunderstanding. There were many who thought that the new
            leader came, in the most literal sense, to fulfil <mark class="term correct">Islámic</mark> Law. They realised, indeed, that the object of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> was to bring about an universal
            kingdom of righteousness and peace, but they thought this was to be effected by wading through streams of blood, and with the help of the divine
            judgments. The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, on the other hand, though not always consistent, was moving, with some of his disciples, in the direction of moral suasion; his
            only weapon was <mark class="term unknown">‘the</mark> sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> When the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> appeared all things would be renewed. But the <mark class="term correct">Qá’im</mark> was on the
            point of appearing, and all that remained was to prepare for his Coming. No more should there be any distinction between higher and lower races, or
            between male and female. No more should the long, enveloping veil be the badge of woman’s inferiority. The gifted woman before us had her
            characteristic solution of the problem... It is said in one form of tradition, that <mark class="term correct">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark> herself attended the conference with a veil on.
            If so, she lost no time in discarding it, and broke out (we are told) into the fervid exclamation, <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> am the blast of the trumpet, I am the call of
            the bugle,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> i.e. <mark class="term unknown">‘Like</mark> Gabriel, I would awaken sleeping souls.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> It is said, too, that this short speech of the brave woman was followed by the
            recitation by <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark> of the <mark class="term correct">Súrih</mark> of the Resurrection (75). Such recitations often have an overpowering effect. The inner meaning of this was
            that mankind was about to pass into a new cosmic cycle, for which a new set of laws and customs would be indispensable.” (Dr. T. K. Cheyne’s “The
            Reconciliation of Races and Religions,” pp. 101–3.)

            Rev. Benjamin Labaree, D.D. (Dr. Cormick was an English physician long resident in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>, where he was highly respected. The document was
            communicated to Professor E. G. Browne of Cambridge University, by Mr. W. A. Shedd, who wrote concerning it, in a letter dated March 1, 1911: “Dear
            Professor Browne, In going over papers of my father (the late Rev. J. H. Shedd, D.D., of the American Mission at <mark class="term correct">Urúmíyyih</mark>, Persia, of the same
            mission as Dr. Benjamin Labaree), I found something which I think may be of value from a historical point of view. I have no books here, nor are
            any accessible here, to be certain whether this bit of testimony has been used or not. I think probably not, and I am sure that I can do nothing
            better than send them to you, with the wish that you may use them as you think best. Of the authenticity of the papers there can be no doubt.”)
        <p></p>“You ask me for some particulars of my interview with the founder of the sect known as <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>. Nothing of any importance transpired in this
            interview, as the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was aware of my having been sent with two other Persian doctors to see whether he was of sane mind or merely a madman, to
            decide the question whether to put him to death or not. With this knowledge he was loth to answer any questions put to him. To all enquiries he
            merely regarded us with a mild look, chanting in a low melodious voice some hymns, I suppose. Two other Siyyids, his intimate friends, were also
            present, who subsequently were put to death with him, besides a couple of government officials. He only once deigned to answer me, on my saying
            that I was not a Musulman and was willing to know something about his religion, as I might perhaps be inclined to adopt it. He regarded me very
            intently on my saying this, and replied that he had no doubt of all Europeans coming over to his religion. Our report to the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> at that
            time was of a nature to spare his life. He was put to death some time after by the order of the <mark class="term misspelled">Amír-Nizám</mark> <mark class="term correction">Amír-Niẓám</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. On our report he
            merely got the bastinado, in which operation a <mark class="term correct">farrá<u>sh</u></mark>, whether intentionally or not, struck him across the face with the stick destined for
            his feet, which produced a great wound and swelling of the face. On being asked whether a Persian surgeon should be brought to treat him, he
            expressed a desire that I should be sent for, and I accordingly treated him for a few days, but in the interviews consequent on this I could never
            get him to have a confidential chat with me, as some government people were always present, he being a prisoner. He was very thankful for my
            attentions to him. He was a very mild and <mark class="term unknown">delicate-looking</mark> man, rather small in stature and very fair for a Persian, with a melodious soft voice,
            which struck me much. Being a <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>, he was dressed in the habit of that sect, as were also his two companions. In fact his whole look and
            deportment went far to dispose on in his favour. Of his doctrine I heard nothing from his own lips, although the idea was that there existed in his
            religion a certain approach to Christianity. He was seen by some Armenian carpenters, who were sent to make some repairs to his prison, reading the
            Bible, and he took no pains to conceal it, but on the contrary told them of it. Most assuredly the Mussulman fanaticism does not exist in his
            religion, as applied to Christians, nor is there that restraint of females that now exists.” In connection with this document, Professor Browne
            writes as follows: “The first of these two documents is very valuable as giving the personal impression produced by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, during the period of
            his imprisonment and suffering, on a cultivated and impartial Western mind. Very few Western Christians can have had the opportunity of seeing,
            still less of conversing with, the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and I do not know of any other who has recorded his impressions.” (E. G. Browne’s Materials for the Study

            blood. Severity in punishing he regarded as wise administration, and harshly entreating, distressing, intimidating, and frightening the people he
            considered as a fulcrum for the advancement of the monarchy. And as His Majesty the King was in the prime of youthful years the minister fell into
            strange fancies and sounded the drum of absolutism in (the conduct of) affairs: on his own decisive resolution, without seeking permission from the
            Royal Presence or taking counsel with prudent statesmen, he issued orders to persecute the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>, imagining that by overweening force he could
            eradicate and suppress matters of this nature, and that harshness would bear good fruit; whereas (in fact) to interfere with matters of conscience
            is simply to give them greater currency and strength; the more you strive to extinguish, the more will the name be kindled, more specially in
            matters of faith and religion, which spread and acquire influence so soon as blood is shed, and strongly affect men’s hearts.”

        <p></p>“The death of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> worried him much more than the wrangling of the <mark class="term unknown">Mullás</mark> and he made ready to go to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> to pay homage to the

            Gobineau describes him in the following terms: “The Turkish and Persian nomads pass their lives in hunting, often also in fighting and above all in
            talking of the hunt and of war. They are brave but not always and they are well described by Branttome who, in his war experience had often

            talkers, great wreckers of towns, great assassins of heroes, great exterminators of multitudes, in a word, naive, very outspoken in their

Professor Browne, of
            Cambridge University, visited the spot on September 26, 1888, and saw the name of the buried saint inscribed on a tablet with the form of words
            used for his “visitation,” the tablet hanging suspended from the railings surrounding the tomb. “It consists at present,” he writes, “of a flat,
            grassy enclosure surrounded by a hedge and containing, besides the buildings of the shrine and another building at the gateway (opposite to which,
            but outside the enclosure, stands the house of the <mark class="term unknown">mutávallí</mark>, or custodian of the shrine), nothing but two or three orange trees and a few rude
            graves covered with flat stones, the last resting places, perhaps, of some of the <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> defenders. The building at the gateway is two storeys high,
            is traversed by the passage giving access to the enclosure, and is roofed with tiles. The buildings of the shrine, which stand at the farther end
            of the enclosure, are rather more elaborate. Their greatest length (about 20 paces) lies east and west; their breadth is about ten paces; and,
besides the covered portico at the entrance they contain two rooms scantily lighted by wooden gratings over the doors. The tomb of the <u>Sh</u>ay            <u>kh</u>, from whom the place takes its name, stands surrounded by wooden railings in the centre of the inner room, to which access is obtained
            either by a door communicating with the outer chamber, or by a door opening externally into the enclosure.” (For plans and sketches, see the

            Amongst them also was <mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, the son of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> the <mark class="term misspelled">Turkaman</mark> <mark class="term correction">Turkamán</mark>, Master of the Horse to his late Majesty <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>.
            And he was a youth graceful of form, comely of face, endowed with all manner of talents and virtues, dignified, temperate gentle, generous,
            courageous, and manly. For the love and service of His Supreme Holiness he forsook both his post and his salary, and shut his eyes alike to rank
            and name, fame and shame, reproaches of friends and revilings of foes. At the first step he left behind him dignity, wealth, position, and all the
            power and consideration which he enjoyed, spent large sums of money (four or five thousand <mark class="term misspelled">túmans</mark> <mark class="term correction">túmáns</mark> at least) in the Cause, and repeatedly showed his
            readiness freely to lay down his life. One of these occasions was when His Supreme Holiness arrived at the village of <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Kh</u>anliq</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Kh</u>ánliq</mark> near <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>,
            and, to try the fidelity of His followers, said: <mark class="term unknown">‘Were</mark> there but a few horsemen who would deliver Me from the bonds of the froward and their
            devices, it were not amiss.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> On hearing these words, several tried and expert horsemen, fully equipped and armed, at once prepared to set out, and,
pronouncing all that they had, hastily conveyed themselves before His Holiness. Amongst these were <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Qurbán-‘Alí</mark>, of <mark class="term unknown">Astaribád</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark>            <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>. When they were come before His Holiness, He smiled and said, “The mountain of <mark class="term misspelled">Á<u>dh</u>irbayján</mark> <mark class="term correction">Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján</mark> has also a claim on Me,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> and bade
            them turn back. After his return, <mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> devoted himself to the service of the friends of God, and his house was often the meeting place
            of the believers, amongst whom both <mark class="term correct">Jináb-i-Quddús</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled">Jináb-i-Babu’l-Báb</mark> <mark class="term correction">Jináb-i-Bábu’l-Báb</mark> were for a while his honoured guests. Indeed, he neither spared himself
            nor fell short in the service of any of this circle, but, notwithstanding his high position, strove with heart md soul to further the object of
            God’s servants. When, for instance, <mark class="term correct">Jináb-i-Quddús</mark> first began to preach the doctrine in <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, and the <mark class="term misspelled">Sa’ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark> <mark class="term correction">Sa‘ídu’l-‘Ulamá’</mark>, being informed of
            this, made strenuous efforts to do him injury, <mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> at once hastened to <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, and, whenever <mark class="term correct">Jináb-i-Quddús</mark> went forth from his
            house, used, in spite of his high position and the respect to which he was accustomed, to walk on foot before him with his drawn sword over his
            shoulder; seeing which, the malignants feared to take any liberty.... For some while, <mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> remained after this fashion in <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>,
            until he accompanied <mark class="term correct">Jináb-i-Quddús</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Ma<u>sh</u>had</mark>. On his return thence, he was present at the troubles at <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark>, where he performed
            the most valuable services, and was entrusted with the most important and delicate commissions. After the meeting at <mark class="term correct">Bada<u>sh</u>t</mark> was dispersed,
            he fell ill, and, in company with <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán-Qulí</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Núr</mark> (a son of the late <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>atír-bá<u>sh</u>í</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>áṭir-bá<u>sh</u>í</mark>, also conspicuous for his virtues,
            learning, and devotion), came to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. <mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>’s illness lasted for some while, and on his recovery the siege of the castle of <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>
            had already waxed grievous. He at once determined to go to the assistance of the garrison. Being, however, a man of mark and well known, he could
            not leave the capital without giving some plausible reason. He therefore pretended to repent his former course of action, and begged that he might
            be sent to take part in the war in <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark>, and thus make amends for the past. The king granted his request, and he was appointed to accompany
            the force proceeding under Prince <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> against the castle. During the march thither he was continually saying to the prince, <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> will do
            this,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> and <mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> will do <mark class="term unknown">that’</mark>, so that the prince came toservices for till the day when battle was inevitable and peace no longer possible, he was
            ever foremost in the army and most active in ordering its affairs. But on the first day of battle he began to gallop his horse and practise other
            martial exercises, until, without having aroused suspicion, he suddenly gave it free rein and effected a junction with the Brethren of Purity. On
            arriving in their midst, he kissed the knee of <mark class="term correct">Jináb-i-Quddús</mark> and prostrated himself before him in thankfulness. Then he once more returned to the
            <mark class="term unknown">battle-field</mark>, and began to revile and curse the prince, saying: <mark class="term unknown">‘Who</mark> is man enough to trample underfoot the pomp and circumstance of the world,
            free himself from the bonds of carnal lusts, and join himself, as I have done, to the saints of God? I, for my part, shall be satisfied with my
            head only when it falls stained with dust and blood in this plain.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Then, like a ravening lion, he rushed upon them with naked brand, and quitted
            himself so manfully that all the royalist officers were astonished, saying: <mark class="term unknown">‘Such</mark> valour must have been newly granted him from on high, or else a
            new spirit hath been breathed into his frame.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> For it happened more than once that he cut down a gunner as he was in the very act of firing his
            gun, while so many of the chief officers of the royalist army fell by his hand that the prince and the other commanding officers desired more
            eagerly to revenge themselves on him than on any other of the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>. Therefore, on the eve of the day appointed for <mark class="term correct">Jináb-i-Quddús</mark> to surrender
            himself at the royalist camp, <mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, knowing that because of the fierce hatred which they bore him they would slay him with the most
            cruelan old and faithful friend and comrade. After the massacre of the other <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>, search was made for <mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, and he was at length
            discovered. The officer who had sheltered him proposed to ransom him for the sum of two thousand <mark class="term misspelled">túmans</mark> <mark class="term correction">túmáns</mark> in cash, but his proposal rejected, and
            though he offered to increase the sum, and strove earnestly to save his friend, it was of no avail, for the prince, because of the exceeding hatred
            he bore <mark class="term correct">Riḍá</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> order him to be hewn in pieces.” (The “<mark class="term misspelled">Tarí<u>kh</u>-i-Jadíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Tárí<u>kh</u>-i-Jadíd</mark>,” pp. 96–101.)

            stones reached a height of ten meters. On this base, they raised a construction made of enormous tree trunks in the middle of which they arranged a
            number of loopholes; they then surrounded it entirely with a deep ditch. In fact it was a kind of great tower having stones for the foundation
            while the higher stories were of wood and provided with three rows of loopholes where they could place as many <mark class="term unknown">tufang-chis</mark> as they wished, or
            rather, as they had. They made openings for many doors and postern gates in order to facilitate entrance and exit.
        <p></p>“They dug wells, thus securing an abundance of water; underground passages were excavated in order to provide refuge in case of need; storehouses
            were built and filled with all sorts of provisions either bought, or perhaps taken in the neighboring villages. Finally, they manned the fortress

        <p></p>“In this sad state, completely bewildered, he was met by a <mark class="term unknown">Mázindarání</mark>, mounted on a fairly good horse, who recognized him. This man dismounted,
            placed the Prince on his horse and offered to serve him as guide. He led him to a peasant’s hut, settled him in the barn (this is not considered a
            place to frown upon in Persia) and while the Prince slept and ate, the <mark class="term unknown">Mázindarání</mark> mounted his horse and, covering the country side, gave out the
            glad tidings that the Prince was safe and well. Thus he brought to him all his men, or at least a respectable number of them, one band after
            another.
        <p></p>“If <mark class="term correct">Mihdí-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> had been one of those proud spirits not easily broken by reverses, he would have considered his position only slightly altered
            by the mishaps of the previous evening; he could have believed that his men had been unfortunately surprised; then with the remainder of his forces
            he would have saved appearances and held the ground, for in fact, the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> had retreated and were out of sight. But the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áhzádih</mark>, far from
            priding himself on such firmness, was a weak character and, when he saw himself so well guarded, he left the barn and hurried to the village of

        <p></p>“Among them was <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, who was made the recipient of the effulgent glory of the Sun of Revelation. But for him, God would not have been

            but a gallant soldier and an impassioned lover of God he combined qualities and characteristics which even in the spiritual aristocracy of Persia
            are seldom found united in the same person.” (Dr. T. K. Cheyne’s “The Reconciliation of Races and Religions,” p. 83.) “At last,” writes Gobineau,
            “he passed away. The new religion, which found in him its first martyr, lost, in the same stroke, a man whose moral strength and ability would have
            been of great value to it, had he lived longer. The <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadans</mark> naturally feel a hatred for the memory of this leader, which is as deep as the love
            and veneration shown for him by the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>. They can both justify their opposing sentiments. What is certain is that <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn-i-Bu<u>sh</u>rú’í</mark>
            was the first to give to <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark>, in the Persian empire, the status which a religious or political body acquires in the eyes of the people only
            after it has demonstrated its warlike strength.” (Comte de Gobineau’s “Les Religions et les Philosophies dans <mark class="term unknown">l’Asie</mark> Centrale,” p. 176.) “The late

            from <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> and from <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark> to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. His sister was the wife of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">Abú-Turáb</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, who was a scholar and
            philosopher such at is rarely met with and believed with the utmost sincerity and purity of purpose, while such was his love and devotion to the
            <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> that if anyone did so much as mention the name of His Supreme Holiness (the souls of all beside him be His sacrifice) he could not restrain his
            tears. Often have I seen him, when engaged in the perusal of the writings of His Supreme Holiness, become almost beside himself with rapture, and
            nearly faint with joy. Of his wife he used to say: “I married her three years ago in <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark>. She was then but an indifferent scholar even in
            Persian, but now she can expound texts from the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> and explain the most difficult questions and most subtle points of the doctrine of the
            Divine Unity in such wise that I have never seen a man who was her equal in this, or in readiness of apprehension. These gifts she has obtained by
            the blessing of His Holiness the Supreme and through converse with her holiness the Pure (<mark class="term correct">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark>). I have seen in her a patience and
            resignation rare even in the most <mark class="term unknown">self-denying</mark> men, for during these three years, though I have not sent her a single dinar for her expenses and
            she has supported herself only with the greatest difficulty, she has never uttered a word; and now that she has come to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, she refrains
            altogether from speaking of the past, and though, in accordance with the wishes of <mark class="term misspelled">Jináb-i-Babu’l-Báb</mark> <mark class="term correction">Jináb-i-Bábu’l-Báb</mark>, she now desires to proceed to <u>Kh</u>
            <mark class="term unknown">urásán</mark>, and has literally nothing to put on save one <mark class="term unknown">well-worn</mark> dress which she wears, she never asks for clothes or <mark class="term unknown">travelling-money</mark>, but ever
            seeks reasonable excuses wherewith to set me at my ease and prevent me from feeling ashamed. Her purity, chastity, and virtue are boundless, and
            during all this while no unprivileged person hath so much as heard her voice.” But the virtues of the daughter were surpassed by those of the
            mother, who possessed rare attainments and accomplishments, and had composed many poems and eloquent elegies on the afflictions of her sons.
            Although <mark class="term misspelled">Jináb-i-Babu’l-Báb</mark> <mark class="term correction">Jináb-i-Bábu’l-Báb</mark> had warned her of his approaching martyrdom and foretold to her all the impending calamities, she still continued to
            exhibit the same eager devotion and cheerful resignation, rejoicing that God had accepted the sacrifice of her sons, and even praying that they
            might attain to this great dignity and not be deprived of so great blessedness. It is indeed wonderful to meditate on this virtuous and saintly
            family, the sons so conspicuous for their <mark class="term unknown">single-minded</mark> devotion and <mark class="term unknown">self-sacrifice</mark>, the mother and daughter so patient and resigned. When I, <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>
            <mark class="term correct">Jání</mark>, met <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥasan</mark>, he was but seventeen years of age, yet I observed in him a dignity, gravity, composure, and virtue which amazed me.

            debated the question whether extreme distress could justify them to disinter the sacred charger and eat the remains. With deep sorrow, they agreed

            spite of the fire which burned constantly in his room, he shivered with cold yet, at the same time, his fever was so high, that nothing could
            quench his intolerable thirst. He died, and his house, which was very beautiful, was abandoned and finally crumbled into ruins. Little by little,
            the practice grew of dumping refuse on the site where it had once so proudly stood. This so impressed the <mark class="term unknown">Mázindaránis</mark> that when they quarrel among

            <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, I heard one, who, though not a believer, was honest, truthful, and worthy of credit, relate as follows: “We were sitting together when
some allusion was made to the war waged by some of those present against <mark class="term misspelled">Ḥaḍrat-i-Quddús</mark> <mark class="term correction">Haḍrat-i-Quddús</mark> and <mark class="term misspelled">Jináb-i-Babu’l-Báb</mark> <mark class="term correction">Jináb-i-Bábu’l-Báb</mark>.

The prince questioned <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Abbás-Qulí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> about the matter, and he replied thus: <mark class="term unknown">‘The</mark> truth of the matter
            is that anyone who had not seen <mark class="term correct">Karbilá</mark> would, if he had seen <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark>, not only have comprehended what there took place, but would have ceased to
            consider it and had he seen <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Bu<u>sh</u>rúyih</mark> he would have been convinced that the Chief of Martyrs had returned to earth; and had
            he witnessed my deeds he would assuredly have said: “This is <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>imr</mark> come back with sword and Lance.” I swear by the sacred plume of His
            Majesty the Centre of the Universe that one day <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>, having on his head a green turban, and over his shoulder a shroud, came forth from
            the castle, stood forth in the open field, and, leaning on a lance which he held in his hand said: “O people, why, without enquiry and under the
            influence of passion and prejudiced misrepresentation, do ye act so cruelly towards us, and strive without cause to shed innocent blood? Be ashamed
            before the Creator of the universe, and at last give us passage, that we may depart out of this land.” Seeing that the soldiers were moved, I
            opened fire and ordered the troops to shout so as to drown his voice. Again I saw him lean on his lance and heard him cry: “Is there any who will
            help me?” three times so that all heard his cry. At that moment all the soldiers were silent and some began to weep, and many of the horsemen were
            visibly affected. Fearing that the army might be seduced from their allegiance, I again ordered them to fire and shout. Then I saw <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark>
            unsheathe his sword raise his face towards heaven, and heard him exclaim: “O God I have completed the proof to this host, but it availeth not.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
            Then he began to attack us on the right and on the left. I swear by God that on that day he wielded the sword in such wise as transcends the power
            of man. Only the horsemen of <mark class="term correct">Mázindarán</mark> held their ground and refused to flee. And when <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> was well warmed to the fray, he overtook a
            fugitive soldier. The soldier sheltered himself behind a tree, and further strove to shield himself with his musket. <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> dealt him such
            blow with his sword that he clave him and the tree and the musket into six pieces. And, during that war not once was his <mark class="term unknown">sword-stroke</mark> at fault, but
            every blow that he struck fell true. And by the nature of their wounds I could recognise all whom <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Ḥusayn</mark> had cut down with his sword, and
            since I had heard and knew that none could rightly wield the sword save the Chief of Believers, and that it was <mark class="term unknown">well-nigh</mark> impossible for sword to
            cut so true, therefore I forbade all who were aware of this thing to mention it or make it known, lest the troops should be discouraged and should
            wax faint in the fight. But in truth I know not what had been shown to these people, or what they had seen, that they came forth to battle with
            such alacrity and joy, and engaged so eagerly and gladly in the strife, without displaying in their countenance any trace of fear or apprehension.
            One would imagine that in their eyes the keen sword and <mark class="term unknown">blood-spilling</mark> dagger were but means to the attainment of everlasting life, so eagerly did
            their necks and bosoms welcome them as they circled like salamanders round the fiery hail of bullets. And the astonishing thing was that all these
            men were scholars and men of learning, sedentary recluses of the college and the cloister, delicately nurtured and of weakly frame, inured indeed
            to austerities, but strangers to the roar of cannon, the rattle of musketry, and the field of battle. During the last three months of the siege,
            moreover, they were absolutely without bread and water, and were reduced to the extreme of weakness through lack of even such pittance of food as
            is sufficient to sustain life. Notwithstanding this, it seemed as if in time of battle a new spirit were breathed into their frames, insomuch that
            the imagination of man cannot conceive the vehemence of their courage and valour. They used to expose their bodies to the bullets and <mark class="term unknown">cannon-balls</mark>
            not only fearlessly and courageously, but eagerly and joyously, seeming to regard the <mark class="term unknown">battle-field</mark> as a banquet, and to be bent on casting away
            their lives.’”’” (The “<mark class="term misspelled">Tarí<u>kh</u>-i-Jadíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Tárí<u>kh</u>-i-Jadíd</mark>,” pp. 106–9.)

            genuineness of this nomination. And I think it very improbable that any company of intensely earnest men should have accepted the document in

            testimony given by the “Seven Martyrs.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> They were men representing all the more important classes in Persia—divines, dervishes, merchants,
            shopkeepers, and government officials; they were men who had enjoyed the respect and consideration of all; they died fearlessly, willingly, almost
            eagerly, declining to purchase life by that mere <mark class="term unknown">lip-denial</mark> which, under the name of <mark class="term correct">kitmán</mark> or <mark class="term correct">taqíyyih</mark>, is recognised by the by the <mark class="term misspelled"><u>sh</u>í’ahs</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>sh</u>í‘ahs</mark>
            as a perfectly justifiable subterfuge in case of peril; they were not driven to despair of mercy as were those who died at <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark>
            <mark class="term misspelled">Tabarsí</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭabarsí</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Zanján</mark> and they sealed their faith with their blood in the public square of the Persian capital wherein is the abode of the foreign

            generally, characterising it as a communism destructive of all order and all morality, express commiseration for the guiltless victims. To the day
            of their martyrdom we may well apply Gobineau’s eloquent reflection on a similar tragedy enacted two years later: ...”This eventful day brought to
            the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> more secret followers than many sermons could have done. I have just said that the impression created by the prodigious endurance of the
            martyrs was deep and lasting. I have often heard repeated the story of that day by eye witnesses, by men close to the government, some even
            important officials. From their accounts, one might easily have believed that they were all <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>, so great was the admiration they felt for
            memories which were not to the honor of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, and so high was the esteem they entertained for the resourcefulness, the hopes and the chances of
            success of the new doctrine.” (“A Traveller’s Narrative,” Note B, pp. 175–176.)

            “It was only too well known that <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>’s were to be found everywhere. Persia was full of them and, if the minds concerned about transcendental

            given themselves up eagerly to the thought and to the promises of a new and more satisfactory world order, one could properly think that the
            turbulent imaginations eager for action, even at the price of failure, the brave and militant hearts, and finally the daring and ambitious would
            easily be tempted to throw themselves in with an army which revealed itself so well supplied with soldiers fit to constitute dauntless battalions.

            father of all the doctrines which were arousing the people, and he decided to remove that cause.” (Comte de Gobineau’s “Les Religions et les

            “In the meantime, <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> resolved to strike at the very head of this monster of <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark> and he imagined that, after such a blow which would
            definitely remove the instigator of that agitation and silence his appeal, the old order would be restored. Nevertheless, strange phenomenon in an
            Asiatic government, and especially in a statesmen like <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">Taqí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> who could indulge in excessive severity without scruple, this
            minister did not order the death of the reformer! He thought that the most effective way to destroy him was to ruin him morally; to bring him out
            of his retreat in <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark> where a halo of suffering, holiness, science and eloquence made him radiate like a sun; to show him to the people
            just as he was—that is to say, just as he thought he was—was the best way to render him harmless by destroying his prestige.
        <p></p>“He was picturing him as a vulgar charlatan, a weak dreamer who did not have courage enough to conceive, still less to direct the daring
            enterprises of his three apostles, or even to take part in them. Such a man, taken to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and brought face to face with the most subtle
            dialecticians of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, could not but surrender shamefully. His influence would vanish the more rapidly than if while destroying his body, one
            allowed to linger in the minds of the people the phantom of a superiority which death would have consecrated. It was therefore decided to arrest
            him and bring him to <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> and, on the way, to exhibit him publicly in chains and humiliated; to make him debate everywhere with the <mark class="term unknown">Mullás</mark>,
            silencing him whenever he would become too audacious; briefly, to engage him in a series of unequal encounters in which he would inevitably meet
            defeat, as he would have been previously demoralized and heartbroken. It was a lion that they were eager to unnerve, hold in chains and strip of
            claws and teeth, then turn him over to the dogs to show how easily they could overpower him. Once defeated, his ultimate fate was of little
            importance.
        <p></p>“This plan was not devoid of sense, but it rested upon premises which were far from proven. It was not enough to imagine that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was without
            courage and firmness, it was necessary that he be really so. But his conduct in the fort of <mark class="term correct"><u>Ch</u>ihríq</mark> gave no such evidence. He prayed and
            worked unceasingly. His meekness was unfailing. Those who came near him felt in spite of themselves the fascinating influence of his personality,
            of his manner and of his speech. His guards were not free from that weakness. He (the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>) felt that his death was near and he would frequently
            refer to it as to a thought that was not only familiar but even pleasant. Suppose, for a moment, that thus exhibited throughout Persia he would
            still remain undaunted? Suppose he would display neither arrogance nor fear but would rise far above his misfortune? Suppose that he succeeded in
            throwing into confusion the learned, subtle, and eloquent doctors arraigned against him? Suppose he would remain more than ever the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> for his old
            followers and become so for the indifferent and even for his enemies? It was risking much in order to gain much, without doubt, but also perhaps to
            lose much and, after having weighed the matter with care, they dared not take the chance.” (Comte de Gobineau’s “Les Religions et les Philosophies

        <p></p>“On the following day, early in the morning, the people of <mark class="term correct">Ḥamzih</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, having opened the doors of the prison, brought out the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and his
            disciples. They made sure that the irons which they had around their necks and on their wrists were secure; they tied to the iron collar of each
            one a long cord the end of which was held by a <mark class="term correct">farrá<u>sh</u></mark>. Then, so that everyone could see them well and recognize them, they walked them
            about the town, through the streets and the bazaars, overwhelming them with blows and insults. The crowd filled the streets and the people climbed
            upon each <mark class="term unknown">others’</mark> shoulders better to see this man who was so much talked about. The <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>’s, scattered in all directions, were trying to arouse
            among some of the onlookers a little pity or some feeling of sympathy which might have helped them to save their Master. The indifferent ones, the
            philosophers, the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ís</mark>, the <mark class="term correct">Súfís</mark>, turned away from the sight with disgust and returned to their houses, or on the contrary
            waited for the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> at a street corner and simply watched him with silent curiosity. The tattered crowd, restless and excitable, flung insulting
            words at the three martyrs, but they were all ready to change their minds with any sudden change of circumstances.
        <p></p>“Finally, the victorious <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadans</mark> pursued the prisoners with insults, tried to break through the guard in order to strike them in the face or on
            the head and when they succeeded, or when a missile thrown by some child would strike the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> or one of his companions in the face, the guard and
            the crowd would burst into laughter.” (Comte de Gobineau’s “Les Religions et les Philosophies dans <mark class="term unknown">l’Asie</mark> Centrale,” p. 220.)

            “Proof of the devotion and steadfastness of this noble man is afforded by a letter in his own blessed writing which was in the possession of his
            brother <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’lláh</mark>, who still lives in <mark class="term correct">Tabríz</mark>. This letter he wrote from the prison, three days or two days before his martyrdom, in reply to
            his brother, who had written to him counselling him to turn aside from his devotion and thraldom; and therein he makes his apology. And since the
            martyr was the younger of the two brethren, therefore he adopts a respectful tone in his letter. The text of this letter of reply is as follows:
            <mark class="term unknown">‘He</mark> is the Compassionate. O my <mark class="term correct">Qiblih</mark>! Thanks be to God, I have no fault to find with my circumstances, and “to every travail rest succeeds.” As to
            what you wrote, that this matter hath no end, what matter, then, hath an end? We, at least, have no discontent therein; being, indeed, unable
            sufficiently to express our gratitude for this blessing. At most we can but be slain for God’s sake, and, oh, what happiness were this! The Lord’s
            will must be accomplished through His servants, neither can prudence avert predestined fate. What God wills comes to pass: there is no strength
            save in God. O my <mark class="term correct">Qiblih</mark>! The end of the life of the world is death: “every soul shall taste of death.” If the appointed destiny which the Lord
            (mighty and glorious is He) hath decreed should overtake me, then God is the guardian of my family, and thou art my trustee; act in such wise as
            accords with God’s good pleasure. Forgive any failure in the respect or duty owed to an elder brother of which I may have been guilty, seek pardon
            for me from all those of my household, and commend me to God. God is my portion, and how good is He as a guardian!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” (The “<mark class="term misspelled">Tarí<u>kh</u>-i-Jadíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Tárí<u>kh</u>-i-Jadíd</mark>,”

            “When the condemned are shot in Persia, they are bound to a post looking away from the spectators so that they are not able to see the signals for
            execution given by the officer.” (Journal Asiatique, 1866, tome 7, p. 377.)
        <p></p>“An intense clamor arose from the crowd at this moment as the onlookers saw the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> freed from his bonds advancing towards them. Amazing to
            believe, the bullets had not struck the condemned but, on the contrary, had broken his bonds and he was delivered. It was a real miracle and God
            alone knows what would have happened without the fidelity and calm of the Christian regiment on this occurrence. The soldiers in order to quiet the
            excitement of the crowd which, being extremely agitated, was ready to believe the claims of a religion which thus demonstrated its truth, showed
            the cords broken by the bullets, implying that no miracle had really taken place. At the same time, they seized the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and tied him again to the
            fatal post. This time the execution was effective. <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadan</mark> justice and ecclesiastical law had asserted themselves. But the crowd, vividly
            impressed by the spectacle they had witnessed, dispersed slowly, hardly convinced that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was a criminal. After all his crime was only a crime
            for the legalists and the world is indulgent toward crimes which it does not understand.” (M.C. Huart’s “La Religion du <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>,” pp. 3–4.)
        <p></p>“An extraordinary thing happened, unique in the annals of the history of humanity: the bullets cut the cords that held the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> and he fell on his

            these, who are worthy of no attention, and who verily are of the outcast? that all may know the degree of My patience, My resignation and
            <mark class="term unknown">self-sacrifice</mark> in the path of God.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” (Idem, the “<mark class="term correct">Kitáb-i-Íqán</mark>,” p. 195.) “The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, the Lord most high, may the life of all be a sacrifice unto Him,
            hath specifically revealed an Epistle unto the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark> of every city, wherein He hath fully set forth the character of the denial and repudiation
            of each of them. Wherefore, take ye good heed, ye who are men of insight!” (Ibid., p. 193.) “This illustrious Soul arose with such power that He
            shook the supports of the religion, of the morals, the conditions, the habits and the customs of Persia, and instituted new rules, new laws, and a
            new religion. Though the great personages of the State, nearly all the clergy, and the public men, arose to destroy and annihilate Him, He alone
            withstood them, and moved the whole of Persia.... He imparted Divine education to an unenlightened multitude and produced marvellous results on the
            thoughts, morals, customs, and conditions of the Persians.” (<mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Bahá</mark>, “Some Answered Questions,” pp. 30–31.) “Christians believe that if Jesus
            Christ had wished to come down from the cross he could have done so easily; he died of his own free will because it was written that he should and
            in order that the prophecies might be fulfilled. The same is true of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, so the <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>’s say, who, in this way, gave a clear sanction to his
            teachings. He likewise died voluntarily because his death was to be the salvation of humanity. Who will ever tell us the words that the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> uttered
            in the midst of the unprecedented turmoil which broke out as he ascended? Who will ever know the memories which stirred his noble soul? Who will
            reveal to us the secret of that death.... The sight of the baseness, the vices, the deceptions of that clergy shocked his pure and sincere soul: he
            felt the need of a thorough reform in public morals and he undoubtedly hesitated more than once, at the thought of a revolution, which seemed
            unavoidable, to free the bodies as well as the minds from the yoke of brutishness and violence which weighed upon all Persia for the selfish
            benefit of a minority ... of pleasure lovers, and to the greatest shame of the true religion of the Prophet. He must have been much perplexed,
            deeply anxious, and he stood in need of the triple shield of which Horace speaks, to throw himself headlong into that ocean of superstition and
            hatred which was fatally to engulf him. His life is one of the most magnificent examples of courage which it has been the privilege of mankind to
            behold, and it is also an admirable proof of the love which our hero felt for his fellow countrymen. He sacrificed himself for humanity, for it he
            gave his body and his soul, for it he endured privations, insults, torture and martyrdom. He sealed, with his very lifeblood, the covenant of
            universal brotherhood. Like Jesus he paid with his life for the proclamation of a reign of concord, equity and brotherly love. More than anyone he
            knew what dreadful dangers he was heaping upon himself. He had been able to see personally the degree of exasperation that a fanaticism, shrewdly
            aroused, could reach; but all these considerations could not weaken his resolve. Fear had no hold upon his soul and, perfectly calm, never looking
            back, in full possession of all his powers, he walked into the furnace.” (A. L. M. <mark class="term unknown">Nicolas’</mark> “<mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark>, dit le <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>,” pp. 203–204, 376.)
        <p></p>“The head of the new religion was dead and, according to the provisions of the prime minister, the minds of the people would now be at peace and
            there was no room for further anxiety, at least from that source. But such political wisdom was baffled and, instead of appeasing the flames, it
            had fanned them into greater violence.”
        <p></p>“We shall see shortly, when I shall examine the religious dogmas preached by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, that the perpetuity of the sect did not in the least depend
            upon his physical presence; all could proceed and grow without him. If the premier had been aware of this fundamental trait of the hostile
            religion, it is not likely that he would have been so eager to do away with a man whose existence, after all, would not have had any more
            significance than his death.” (Comte de Gobineau’s “Les Religions et les Philosophies dans <mark class="term unknown">l’Asie</mark> Centrale,” pp. 224–225.) Such a prophet,” writes
            the Rev. Dr. T. K.Cheyne, “was the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>; we call him ‘prophet’ for want of a better name, <mark class="term unknown">‘yea</mark>, I say unto you, a prophet and more than a prophet.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
            His combination of mildness and power is so rare that we have to place him in a line with <mark class="term unknown">super-normal</mark> men.... We learn that at great points in his
            career, after he had been in an ecstasy, such radiance of might and majesty streamed from his countenance that none could bear to look upon the
            effulgence of his glory and beauty. Nor was it an uncommon occurrence for unbelievers involuntarily to bow down in lowly obeisance on beholding His
            Holiness—while the inmates of the castle though for the most part Christians and Sunnis, reverently prostrated themselves whenever they saw the
            visage of His Holiness. Such transfiguration is well known to the saints. It was regarded as the affixing of the heavenly seal to the reality and
            completeness of [the] <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s detachment.” (“The Reconciliation of Races and Religions,” pp. 8–9.) “Who can fail to be attracted by the gentle spirit
            of <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark>? His sorrowful and persecuted life; his purity of conduct, and youth; his courage and uncomplaining patience under
            misfortune; his complete <mark class="term unknown">self-negation</mark>; the dim ideal of a better state of things which can be discerned through the obscure and mystic utterances
            of the <mark class="term correct">Bayán</mark>; but most of all his tragic death, all serve to enlist our sympathies on behalf of the young Prophet of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. The
            irresistible charm which won him such devotion during his life still lives on, and still continues to influence the minds of the Persian people.”
            (E. G. Browne’s art. “The <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>’s of Persia,” Journal of J. R. A. S., 1889, p. 933.) “Few believe that by these sanguinary measures the doctrines of
            [the] <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> will cease from propagation. There is a spirit of change abroad among the Persians, which will preserve his system from extinction;
            besides which, his doctrines are of an attractive nature to Persians. Though now subdued, and obliged to lurk concealed in towns, it is conjectured
            that the creed of [the] <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, far from diminishing, is daily spreading.” Lady Sheil’s “Glimpses of Life and Manners in Persia,” p. 181.) “The story
            of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, as <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark> called himself, was the story of spiritual heroism unsurpassed in Svabhava’s experience; and his own adventurous
            soul was fired by it. That a youth of no social influence and no education should, by the simple power of insight, be able to pierce into the heart
            of things and see the real truth, and then hold on to it with such firmness of conviction and present it with such suasion that he was able to
            convince men that he was the Messiah and get them to follow him to death itself, was one of those splendid facts in human history that Svabhava
            loved to meditate on... The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>’s passionate sincerity could not be doubted, for he had given his life for his faith. And that there must be
            something in his message that appealed to men and satisfied their souls was witnessed to by the fact that thousands gave their lives in his cause
            and millions now follow him. If a young man could, in only six years of ministry, by the sincerity of his purpose and the attraction of his
            personality, so inspire rich and poor, cultured and illiterate, alike, with belief in himself and his doctrines that they would remain staunch
            though hunted down and without trial sentenced to death, sawn asunder, strangled, shot, blown from guns; and if men of high position and culture in
            Persia, Turkey and Egypt in numbers to this day adhere to his doctrines, his life must be one of those events in the last hundred years which is
            really worth study.” (Sir Francis Younghusband’s “The Gleam,” pp. 183–4.) “Thus, in only his thirtieth year, in the year 1850, ended the heroic
            career of a true <mark class="term unknown">God-man</mark>. Of the sincerity of his conviction that he was <mark class="term unknown">God-appointed</mark>, the manner of his death is the amplest possible proof. In
            the belief that he would thereby save others from the error of their present beliefs he willingly sacrificed his life. And of his power of
            attaching men to him the passionate devotion of hundreds and even thousands of men who gave their lives in his cause is convincing testimony.”
            (Ibid., p. 210.) “The <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> was dead, but not <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark>. He was not the first, and still less the last, of a long line of martyrs who have testified
            that even in a country gangrened with corruption and atrophied with indifferentism like Persia, the soul of a nation survives, inarticulate
            perhaps, and in a way helpless, but still capable of sudden spasms of vitality.” (Valentine Chirol’s “The Middle Eastern Question,” p. 120.)

        <p></p>“Picture to yourself a Persian city. The streets are narrow, of a width of four or five or eight feet at the most. The surface unpaved has so many
            holes that one must proceed cautiously to avoid breaking one’s legs. The houses, with no windows opening on the street, present on both sides
            unbroken walls, generally about fifteen feet high and topped with a terrace without a railing, sometimes crowned by a <mark class="term unknown">bala-<u>Kh</u>anih</mark> or open
            pavilion which is usually an indication of a wealthy house. All that is of adobe or bricks baked in the sun. The uprights are of bricks baked in
            the kiln. This type, of venerable antiquity and in use even before historical times in the ancient cities of Mesopotamia, has many advantages: it
            is inexpensive, it is sanitary, it adapts itself to modest or pretentious plans; it can be a cottage or a palace entirely covered with mosaics,
            brilliant paintings and gold ornaments. But, as is always the case in this world, so many advantages are offset by the ease with which such
            dwellings crumble to pieces. Cannon balls are not needed, the rain is quite sufficient to demolish them. Thus we can visualize these famous sites
            covered, according to tradition, with immense cities of which nothing remains but ruins of temples and palaces and mounds scattered over the
            plains.

            “In the morning, the king went out for a horseback ride. Before him, as usual, went equerries carrying long lances, grooms leading horses with
            embroidered saddle cloths, and a group of nomad riders with their rifles slung over the shoulder and their swords hanging from their saddles. This
            vanguard preceded the king in order that he might not be annoyed by the dust raised by the cavalry, and the king followed along slowly, a little
            distance from the retinue of the great lords, chiefs and officers who accompanied him everywhere. He was near the palace and had barely passed the
            small door of the garden of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥasan</mark>, <mark class="term unknown">Sanduq-dar</mark> or treasurer of the Savings, when he noticed, at the side of the road, three men, three
            gardeners, standing two on the left, and one on the right side, seemingly waiting for him. He did not suspect danger and rode on. When quite close,
            he saw them bow very low and he heard them cry out together, <mark class="term unknown">‘We</mark> are your sacrifice! We make a request.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> This is the traditional formula, but
            instead of remaining aloof as is customary, they rushed on him repeating, <mark class="term unknown">‘We</mark> make a request!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Surprised, the king shouted, <mark class="term unknown">‘Rascals</mark>, what do you
            want?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> At that moment, the man on his right took hold of the bridle of the horse and fired upon the king. In the meantime, the two men on the left
            fired also. One of the shots cut the collar of pearls adorning the horse’s neck, another riddled with buckshot the right arm and back of the king.
            Immediately, the man on the right pulled on the leg of His Majesty and would have unsaddled him, had it not been that the two assassins on the left
            were pulling on the other side. The king was striking his assailants on the head with his fists, while the jumping of the frightened horse
            paralyzed their efforts and delayed their aggression. The royal retinue, at first dumbfounded, hurried towards their master. <mark class="term correct">Asadu’lláh</mark> <u>Kh</u>
            <mark class="term unknown">án</mark>, the grand equerry, and one of the nomad riders killed the man on the right with their swords. In the meantime, several lords threw down the
            other two men and bound them.
        <p></p>“Doctor Cloquet, the court physician, had the king brought quickly into the garden of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad-Ḥasan</mark>, <mark class="term unknown">Sanduq-dar</mark>; as no one seemed to know what had
            really happened, and those who sensed an imminent danger, had no idea of what a catastrophe it might be. During more than an hour, a great tumult
            reigned in the city of <mark class="term unknown">Níyávarán</mark>, while ministers headed by the <mark class="term unknown">Sadr-i-‘Aẓam</mark> rushed into the garden. The bugles, the drums, the tambourines and the
            fifes were calling the troops together; the <u>gh</u>ulams came riding at full speed; everyone was giving orders, no one saw, heard or knew
            anything. In the midst of this confusion a courier arrived from <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, sent by <mark class="term unknown">Ardi<u>sh</u>ír</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark>, governor of the city, to enquire what had
            happened and what measures should be taken in the capital, for, on the previous evening, the rumor had grown into a certainty that the king had
            been assassinated. The bazaars, policed by men in arms, had been deserted by the merchants. All night long, bakeries had been surrounded, everyone
            trying to store up provisions for several days, as people do when they foresee trouble.
        <p></p>“At dawn, as the agitation grew, <mark class="term unknown">Ardi<u>sh</u>ír</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> had ordered the gates of the citadel of the town closed, put the regiment on a war footing,
            and pointed his guns, although he did not know who the enemy was; and now he was asking for orders.” (Comte de Gobineau’s “Les Religions et les

            Lord Curzon, who regards this event as being “most unfairly mistaken for a revolutionary and anarchical conspiracy,” writes as follows: “From the
facts that <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark> in its earliest years found itself in conflict with the civil powers, and that an attempt was made by <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> upon the life of the            <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, it has been wrongly inferred that the movement was political in origin and Nihilist in character. It does not appear from a study of
            the writings either of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> or his successors, that there is any foundation for such a suspicion. The persecution of the government very early
            drove the adherents of the new creed into an attitude of rebellion; and in the exasperation produced by the struggle, and by the ferocious
            brutality with which the rights of conquest were exercised by the victors, it was not surprising if fanatical hands were found ready to strike the
            sovereign down. At the present time the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> are equally loyal with any other subjects of the Crown. Nor does there appear to be any greater
            justice in the charges of socialism, communism, and immorality, that have so freely been levelled at the youthful persuasion. Certainly no such
            idea as communism in the European sense, i.e., a forcible redistribution of property, or as socialism in the nineteenth century sense i.e., the
            defeat of capital by labour, ever entered the brain of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> or his disciples. The only communism known to and recommended by him was that of the
            New Testament and the early Christian Church, viz the sharing of goods in common by members of the faith, and the exercise of almsgiving, and an
            ample charity. The charge of immorality seems to have arisen partly from the malignant inventions of opponents, partly from the much greater
            freedom claimed for women by the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, which in the Oriental mind is scarcely dissociable from profligacy of conduct.... Broadly regarded, <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark>
            may be defined as a creed of charity, and almost of common humanity. Brotherly love, kindness to children, courtesy combined with dignity,
            sociability, hospitality, freedom from bigotry, friendliness even to Christians, are included in its tenets. That every <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> recognises or observes
            these precepts would be a foolish assertion; but let a prophet, if his gospel be in question, be Judged by his own preaching.” (Lord Curzon’s

            manuscript copy of an article in German published on October 17, 1852 in No. 291 of some German or Austrian newspaper of which, unhappily, the name
            is not noted. I think that I received it a good many years ago from the widow of the late Dr. Polak, an Austrian doctor, who was a physician to
            <mark class="term correct">Náṣiri’d-Dín</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> at the beginning of his reign, and who is the author of a valuable book and several smaller treatises on Persia and
            matters connected therewith. It is chiefly based on a letter written on August 29, 1852, by an Austrian officer, Captain von Goumoens, who was in
            the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s service, but who was so disgusted, and horrified at the cruelties he was compelled to witness that he sent in his resignation.
            The translation of this article is as follows: <mark class="term unknown">‘Some</mark> days ago we mentioned the attempt made on the life of the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> of Persia on the
            occasion of a <mark class="term unknown">hunting-party</mark>. The conspirators, as is well known, belonged to the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>, a religious sect. Concerning this sect and the repressive
            measures adopted against it, the letter of Austrian Captain von Goumoens lately published in the “Soldier’s Friend” (Soldatenfreund) contains
            interesting disclosures, and elucidates to some extent the attempt in question. This letter runs as follows: “<mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, August 29, 1852. Dear Friend,
            My last letter of the 20th inst. mentioned the attempt on the King. I will now communicate to you the result of the interrogation to which the two
            criminals were subjected. In spite of the terrible tortures inflicted, the examination extorted no comprehensive confession; the lips of the
            fanatics remained closed, even when by means of <mark class="term unknown">red-hot</mark> pincers and <mark class="term unknown">limb-rending</mark> screws they sought to discover the chief conspirator.... But
            follow me, my friend, you who lay claim to a heart and European ethics, follow me to the unhappy ones who, with <mark class="term unknown">gouged-out</mark> eyes, must eat, on the
            scene of the deed, without any sauce, their own amputated ears; or whose teeth are torn out with inhuman violence by the hand of the executioner;
            or whose bare skulls are simply crushed by blows from a hammer; or where the bazar is illuminated with unhappy victims, because on right and left
            the people dig deep holes in their breasts and shoulders and insert burning wicks in the wounds. I saw some dragged in chains through the bazar
            preceded by a military band, in whom these wicks had burned so deep that now the fat flickered convulsively in the wound like a <mark class="term unknown">newly-extinguished</mark>
            lamp. Not seldom it happens that the unwearying ingenuity of the Orientals leads to fresh tortures. They will skin the soles of the <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>’s feet,
            soak the wounds in boiling oil, shoe the foot like the hoof of a horse, and compel the victim to run. No cry escaped from the victim’s breast; the
            torment is endured in dark silence by the numbed sensation of the fanatic; now he must run; the body cannot endure what the soul has endured; he
            falls. Give him the coup de grace! Put him out of his pain! No! The executioner swings the whip, and—I myself have had to witness it—the unhappy
            victim of hundredfold tortures and runs! This is the beginning of the end. As for the end itself, they hang the scorched and perforated bodies by
            their hands and feet to a tree head downwards, and now every Persian may try his marksmanship to heart’s content from a fixed but not too proximate
            distance on the noble quarry placed at his disposal. I saw corpses torn by nearly 150 bullets.... When I read over again what I have written I am
            overcome by the thought that those who are with you in our dearly beloved Austria may doubt the full truth of the picture, and accuse me of
            exaggeration. Would to God that I had not lived to see it! But by the duties of my profession I was unhappily often, only too often, a witness of
            these abominations. At present I never leave my house, in order not to meet with fresh scenes of horror. After their death the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> are hacked in
            two and either nailed to the city gate, or cast out into the plain as food for the dogs and jackals. Thus the punishment extends even beyond the
            limits which bound this bitter world, for <mark class="term misspelled">Musulmans</mark> <mark class="term correction">Musulmáns</mark> who are not buried have no right to enter the Prophet’s Paradise. Since my whole soul revolts
            against such infamy, against such abominations as recent times, according to the judgment of all, present, I will no longer maintain my connection
            with the scene of such crimes.”<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> (He goes on to say that he has already asked for his discharge, but has not yet received an answer.)” (E. G.

        <p></p>“Ardishir <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> was forced to act in consequence. He kept the gates of the city closed and guarded, giving orders to examine closely all those who

        <p></p>“The police force in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, as in all Asiatic cities, is very well organized. It is a legacy of the Sassanides which the Arabian <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>alífs</mark>

            has remained, so to speak, unchanged, in the midst of the ruins of other institutions, equally efficient, which have decayed.

            policemen who, without either uniform or badge, never leave the streets which are assigned to them. They are generally well liked by the people and
            they live on familiar terms with them. They are helpful at all times and, at night, be it winter or summer, they recline under the awning of any
            store, indifferent to rain or snow, and watch over private property. In this way they reduce the number of thefts by rendering them difficult.
            Moreover, they know every dweller and his ways, so that they can assist in case of investigation; they know the minds, the opinions, the
            acquaintances, the relations of everyone; and if one asks three friends to dinner, the <mark class="term unknown">sar-<u>gh</u>i<u>sh</u>mih</mark> without spying, so well informed

            those two chains, one of which is known as <mark class="term unknown">Qará-Guhar</mark> and the other as <mark class="term unknown">Salásil</mark>. I swear by the <mark class="term unknown">Day-star</mark> of Justice, that during four months, I was

            calamities.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” (“The Epistle to the Son of the Wolf,” p. 57.) “Concerning the Persian mode of imprisonment, the practice is as different from our
            own as in the case of penalties. There is no such thing as penal servitude for life, or even for a term of years; hard labour is unknown as a
            sentence; and confinement for any lengthy period is rare. There is usually a <mark class="term unknown">gaol-delivery</mark> at the beginning of the new year; and when a fresh
            governor is appointed, he not uncommonly empties the prison that may have been filled by his predecessor, one or two of the worst cases, perhaps,
            suffering the death penalty, in order to create a salutary impression of strength. There is no such thing as a female ward, women being detained,
            as also are male criminals of high rank, in the house of a priest. In <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> there are said to be three kinds of prison the subterranean cells
            beneath the Ark, where criminals guilty of conspiracy, or high treason are reported to have been confined; the town prison, where the vulgar
            criminals may be seen with iron collars round their neck, sometimes with their feet in stocks, and attached to each other by iron chains; and the
            private <mark class="term unknown">guard-house</mark>, that is frequently an appurtenance of the mansions of the great. It will be seen that the Persian theory of justice, as
            expressed both in judicial sentences, in the infliction of penalties, and in the prison code, is one of sharp and rapid procedure, whose object is
            the punishment (in a manner as roughly equivalent as possible to the original offence), but in no sense the reformation, of the culprit.” Lord

            “We had nothing to do with this odious deed, and Our innocence was indisputably proved before the tribunals. Nevertheless, they arrested Us and
            brought Us to the prison in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, from <mark class="term unknown">Níyávarán</mark>, which was then the seat of the royal residence; on foot, in chains, and with bare head and
            feet, for a brutal fellow who was accompanying Us on horseback snatched the hat from Our head, and many executioners and <mark class="term unknown">farrá<u>sh</u>es</mark> hurried
            Us along with great speed and put Us for four months in a place the like of which has not been seen. In reality, a dark and narrow cell were far
            better than the place where this wronged One and His companions were confined. When We entered the prison, on arrival, they conducted us along a
            dismal corridor, and thence We descended three steep stairs to the dungeon appointed for Us. The place was dark, and its inmates numbered nearly a
            hundred and fifty—thieves, assassins, and highway robbers. Holding such a crowd as this, it yet had no outlet but the passage through which We
            entered. The pen fails to describe this place and putrid stench. Most of the company had neither clothes to wear nor mat to lie on. God knows what
            We endured in that gloomy and loathsome place! By day and by night, in this prison We reflected on the condition of the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> and their doings and
            affairs, wondering how, notwithstanding their greatness of soul, nobility, and intelligence, they could be capable of such a deed as this audacious
            attempt on the life of the sovereign. Then did this wronged One determine that, on leaving this prison, He would arise with the utmost endeavour
            for the regeneration of these souls. One night, in a dream, this <mark class="term unknown">all-glorious</mark> word was heard from all sides: <mark class="term unknown">‘Verily</mark> We will aid Thee to triumph by

            “His Excellency resolved to divide the execution of the victims among the different departments of the state; the only person he exempted was
            himself. First came the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>, who was entitled to Qisas, or legal retaliation, for his wound. To save the dignity of the crown, the steward
of the household, as the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s representative, fired the first shot at the conspirator selected as his victim, and his deputies, the <mark class="term unknown">farrá</mark>            <u>sh</u>es, completed the work. The Prime Minister’s son headed the Home Office, and slew another <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>. Then came the Foreign Office. The
            Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a pious, silly man, who spent his time in conning over the traditions of <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark>, With averted face made
            the first swordcut, and then the <mark class="term unknown">Under-Secretary</mark> of State and clerks of the Foreign Office hewed their victim into pieces. The priesthood, the

            many men professionally to permit him to increase their number by any voluntary homicide on his part. The Sadr was reminded that these barbarous
            and <mark class="term unknown">unheard-of</mark> proceedings were not only revolting in themselves, but would produce the utmost horror and disgust in Europe. Upon this he became

            from the <mark class="term misspelled">‘Ṭihrán</mark> <mark class="term correction">Ṭihrán</mark> <mark class="term unknown">Gazette’</mark> of that day, and will serve as a specimen of a Persian ‘leader’: <mark class="term unknown">‘Some</mark> profligate, unprincipled individuals, destitute of

            They were unable to prove the truth of their faith, the falsehood of which was visible. For instance, many of their books having fallen into our
            hands, they are found to contain nothing but pure infidelity. In worldly argument, too, they never were able to support their religion, which
            seemed fit only for entering into a contest with the Almighty. They then began to think of aspiring to sovereignty, and to endeavour to raise
insurrections, hoping to profit by the confusion, and to pillage the property of their neighbours. A wretched miserable gang, whose chief, <mark class="term correct">Mullá</mark>            <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí</mark> of <mark class="term unknown">Tur<u>sh</u>íz</mark>, styled himself the deputy of the former <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, and who gave himself the title of High Majesty, collected
            round themselves some of the former companions of [the] <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. They seduced to their principles some dissolute debauchees, one of whom was <mark class="term correct">Ḥájí</mark>

            and to plan an attempt on the auspicious life of his Majesty. Twelve of their number, who were volunteers for the deed, were selected to execute
            their purpose, and to each of them were given pistols, daggers, etc. It was resolved that the above number should proceed to the <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark>’s

            persons, whose crimes were not so clearly proved, were condemned to perpetual imprisonment; the remainder were divided among the priesthood, the

            Persia,” pp. 277–81.)
        <p></p>”On that day, a spectacle was witnessed in the streets and bazaars of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> which the people can never forget. Even to this very day, it
            remains the topic of conversation; one still feels a shocking horror which the years have not been able to lessen. The people saw marching, between
            executioners, children and women with deep holes cut into their flesh in which lighted wicks were inserted. The victims were dragged with ropes and
            goaded on with whips. Children and women went forth singing this verse: <mark class="term unknown">‘In</mark> truth, we come from God and unto Him do we return.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Their voices were
            raised triumphant above the deep silence of the crowd, for the citizens of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark> were neither mean nor great believers in <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>. When one of the
            victims fell to the ground and they prodded him up with bayonets, if the loss of blood which dripped from his wounds had left him any strength, he
            would begin to dance and to cry out with even greater enthusiasm: <mark class="term unknown">‘In</mark> truth, we come from God and unto Him do we return!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
        <p></p>“Some of the children expired on the way. The executioners would throw their bodies under the feet of their fathers and sisters, who proudly walked
            over them without giving it a second thought. When the cortège reached the place of execution near the New Gate, the victims were given the choice
            between life and abjuration of their faith; they were even subjected to every form of intimidation. One of the executioners conceived the idea of
            saying to a father that, unless he yielded, he would cut the throats of his two sons on his very breast. The sons were quite young, the oldest
            about fourteen. Covered with blood, their flesh scorched, they were listening stoically to the threats. The father replied, while laying himself
            down, that he was ready and the older of the boys, claiming a prior right, requested to be the first to die. It may be that the executioner denied
            him even that last comfort.
        <p></p>“At last, the tragedy was over and night fell upon a heap of formless bodies; the heads were tied in bundles to the posts of justice and the dogs
            on the outskirts of the city were crowding about. That day won for the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> a larger number of secret followers than much exhortation could have
            done.
        <p></p>“As I have said above, the impression caused by the terrifying impassibility of the martyrs was deep and lasting. I have often heard eye witnesses
            describe the scenes of that fateful day, men close to the government, some even holding important positions. While listening to them, one could
            easily have believed that they were all <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>, so great was their admiration for the events in which <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> played so inglorious a part, and so high
            a conception did they entertain of the resources, the hopes and the means of success of the new religion.” (Comte de Gobineau’s “Les Religions et
            les Philosophies dans <mark class="term unknown">l’Asie</mark> Centrale,” pp. 248–250.) “These executions were not merely criminal, but foolish. The barbarity of the persecutors
            defeated its own ends, and instead of inspiring terror, gave the martyrs and opportunity of exhibiting a heroic fortitude which has done more than
            any propaganda, however skilful, could have done to ensure the triumph of the cause for which they died.... The impression produced by such
            exhibitions of courage and endurance was profound and lasting; nay, the faith which inspired the martyrs was often contagious, as the following
            incident shows. A certain Yazdi rough, noted for his wild and disorderly life, went to see the execution of some <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>, perhaps to scoff at them.
            But when he saw with what calmness and steadfastness they met torture and death, his feelings underwent so great a revulsion that he rushed forward
            crying, <mark class="term unknown">‘Kill</mark> me too! I am also a <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> And thus he continued to cry till he too was made a partaker in the doom he had come out only to gaze
            upon.” (E. G. Browne’s “A Year amongst the Persians,” pp. 111–12.)

            I have come with winsome airs and graces! Such is the lover’s madness!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> <mark class="term unknown">‘Why</mark> do you not dance,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> asked the executioners mockingly, <mark class="term unknown">‘since</mark> you find

Such a dance in the
            midst of the <mark class="term unknown">market-place</mark> is my desire!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” (“A Traveller’s Narrative,” Note T, pp. 333–4.) He was martyred in August, 1852. “When they arrested
            <mark class="term correct">Sulaymán</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark>, and strove, in consideration of his faithful service and loyalty, to induce him, by promises of rewards from the king, to
            abandon the creed which he had adopted, he would not consent, but answered firmly: <mark class="term unknown">‘His</mark> Majesty the King has a right to demand from his servants
            fidelity, loyalty, and uprightness; but he is not entitled to meddle with their religious convictions.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> In consequence of this boldness of speech,
            it was ordered that his body should be pierced with wounds, and that into each of these wounds a lighted candle should be inserted as an example to
            others. Another victim was similarly treated. In this state, with minstrels and drummers going in advance, they led him through the bazaars, and
            he, meanwhile, with smiling countenance, kept repeating these verses:
        <p></p><mark class="term unknown">‘Happy</mark> he whom love’s intoxication
            <br>So hath overcome that scare he knows
            <br>Whether at the feet of the Beloved
            <br>It be head or turban which he throws!<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
        <p></p>Whenever one of the candles fell from his body, he would with his own hand pick it up, light it from the others, and replace it. The executioners,
            seeing in him such exultation and rapture said: <mark class="term unknown">‘If</mark> thou art so eager for martyrdom, why dost thou not dance?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> Thereat he began to leap, and to
            sing, in verses appropriate to his condition:
        <p></p><mark class="term unknown">‘An</mark> ear no longer dulled with ignorance
            <br>And <mark class="term unknown">self-subdued</mark> entitles one to dance.
            <br>Fools dance and caper in the <mark class="term unknown">market-place</mark>;
            <br>Men dance the while their <mark class="term unknown">life-blood</mark> flows apace.
            <br>When self is slain, they clap their hands in glee,
            <br>And dance, because from evil they are free.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>
        <p></p>In such fashion did they lead these two forth through the gate of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>áh</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-‘Aẓím</mark>. When they were preparing to saw that brave man
            asunder, he stretched out his feet without fear or hesitation, while he recited these verses:
        <p></p><mark class="term unknown">‘I</mark> hold this body as of little worth;
            <br>A brave man’s spirit scorns its house of earth.

            “If one conclusion more than another has been forced upon our notice by the retrospect in which I have indulged, it is that a sublime and
            unmurmuring devotion has been inculcated by this new faith, whatever it be. There is, I believe, but one instance of a <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> having recanted under
            pressure or menace of suffering, and he reverted to the faith and was executed with two years. Tales of magnificent heroism illumine the
            <mark class="term unknown">blood-stained</mark> pages of <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> history. Ignorant and unlettered as many of the votaries are, and have been, they are yet prepared to die for their
            religion, and the fires of Smithfield did not kindle a nobler courage than has met and defined the more refined <mark class="term unknown">torture-mongers</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>. Of no
            small account, then, must be the tenets of a creed that can awaken in its followers so rare and beautiful a spirit of <mark class="term unknown">self-sacrifice</mark>.... It is
            these little incidents, protruding from time to time their ugly features, that prove Persia to be not as yet quite redeemed, and that somewhat a

domestic disputes followed, not always to the advantage and credit of the husband.

            never existed, they could only be the superstitions of diseased brains. She expounded the new doctrine, bringing out its truth, but always
            encountered the same argument of <mark class="term misspelled">Jabúlqá</mark> <mark class="term correction">Jábulqá</mark>. Exasperated, she finally told them: <mark class="term unknown">‘Your</mark> reasoning is that of an ignorant and stupid child; how long

        <p></p>“Beauty and the female see also lent their consecration to the new creed and the heroism of the lovely but <mark class="term unknown">ill-fated</mark> poetess of <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, <mark class="term unknown">Zarrín-Táj</mark>
            (Crown of Gold; or <mark class="term correct">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark> (Solace of the Eyes), who, throwing off the veil, carried the missionary torch far and wide, is one of the most
            affecting episodes in modern history.” (Lord Curzon’s “Persia and the Persian Question,” vol. 1, p. 497, note 2.) “No memory is more deeply
            venerated or kindles greater enthusiasm than hers, and the influence which she wielded in her lifetime still inures to her sex.” (Valentine
            Chirol’s “The Middle Eastern Question,” p. 124.) “The appearance of such a woman as <mark class="term correct">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark> is in any country and any age a rare phenomenon,
            but in such a country as Persia it is a prodigy—nay, almost a miracle. Alike in virtue of her marvellous beauty, her rare intellectual gifts, her
            fervid eloquence her fearless devotion, and her glorious martyrdom, she stands forth incomparable and immortal amidst her countrywomen. Had the
            <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> religion no other claim to greatness, this were sufficient—that it produced a heroine like <mark class="term correct">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark>.” (“A Traveller’s Narrative,” Note
            Q, p. 213.) “Almost the most remarkable figure in the whole movement was the poetess <mark class="term correct">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark>. She was known for her virtue, piety, and
            learning, and had been finally converted on reading some of the verses and exhortations of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>. So strong in her faith did she become that
            although she was both rich and noble she gave up wealth, child, name and position for her Master’s service and set herself to proclaim and
            establish his doctrine... The beauty of her speech was such as to draw guests from a marriage feast rather than listen to the music provided by the
            host. And her verses were among the most stirring in the Persian language.” (Sir Francis Younghusband’s “The Gleam,” pp. 202–3.) “Looking back on
            the short career or <mark class="term correct">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark>, one is chiefly struck by her fiery enthusiasm and by her absolute unworldliness. This world was, in fact, to
            her, as it was said to be to <mark class="term correct">Quddús</mark>, a mere handful of dust. She was also an eloquent speaker and experienced in the intricate measures of Persian
            poetry. One of her few Poems which have thus far been made known is of special interest, because of the belief which it expresses in the
            <mark class="term unknown">divine-human</mark> character of some one (here called Lord), whose claims, when once adduced, would receive general recognition. Who was this Personage?
            It appears that <mark class="term correct">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark> thought Him slow in bringing forward these claims. Is there any one who can be thought of but <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>? The
            poetess was a true <mark class="term correct">Bahá’í</mark>.” (Dr. T. K. Cheyne’s “The Reconciliation of Races and Religions,” pp. 114, 115.) “The harvest sown in <mark class="term correct">Islámic</mark> lands by
            <mark class="term correct">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark> is now beginning to appear. A letter addressed to the “Christian Commonwealth” last June informs us that forty Turkish suffragettes
            are being deported from Constantinople to <mark class="term misspelled">Akká</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Akká</mark> (so long the prison of <mark class="term correct">Bahá’u’lláh</mark>): <mark class="term unknown">‘During</mark> the last few years suffrage ideas have been spreading
            quietly behind in the harems. The men were ignorant of it; everybody was ignorant of it; and now suddenly the floodgate is opened and the men of
            Constantinople have thought it necessary to resort to drastic measures. Suffrage clubs have been organised, intelligent memorials incorporating the
            women’s demands have been drafted and circulated; women’s journals and magazines have sprung up, publishing excellent articles; and public meetings
            were held. Then one day the members of these clubs—four hundred of them—cast away their veils. The staid, fossilised class of society were shocked,
            the good <mark class="term misspelled">Musulmans</mark> <mark class="term correction">Musulmáns</mark> were alarmed, and the Government forced into action. These four hundred <mark class="term unknown">liberty-loving</mark> women were divided into several groups.
            One group composed of forty have been exiled to <mark class="term misspelled">Akká</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Akká</mark>, and will arrive in a few days. Everybody is talking about it, and it is really surprising to
            see how numerous are those in favour of removing the veils from the faces of the women. Many men with whom I have talked think the custom not only
            archaic, but <mark class="term unknown">thought-stifling</mark>. The Turkish authorities, thinking to extinguish this light of liberty, have greatly added to its flame, and their
            <mark class="term unknown">high-handed</mark> action has materially assisted the creation of a wider public opinion and a better understanding of this crucial problem.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” (Ibid., pp.

        <p></p>”The other missionary, the woman to whom I refer, had come to <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>. She was without doubt, at the same time, the object of the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> highest
            veneration and one of the most strikingly fascinating manifestations of that religion.” (Comte de Gobineau’s “Les Religions et les Philosophies
            dans <mark class="term unknown">l’Asie</mark> Centrale,” p. 136.)
        <p></p>“Many who have known her and heard her at different times have stated that, for a person so learned and so well read, the outstanding
            characteristic of her discourse was an amazing simplicity and still, when she spoke, her audience was deeply stirred and filled with admiration,
            often in tears.” (Ibid., p. 150.) “Although the <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadans</mark> and <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> speak in the highest terms of the beauty of <mark class="term unknown">‘Consolation</mark> of the Eyes,<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> it is
            beyond dispute that the intelligence and character of this young woman were even more remarkable than has been related. Having heard, almost daily,
            learned conversations, it seems that, at an early age, she had taken a deep interest in them; hence it came about that she was perfectly able to
            follow the subtle arguments of her father, her uncle, her cousin and now her husband, and even to debate with them and frequently to astonish them
            with the power and keenness of her mind. In Persia, one does not frequently see women engaged in intellectual pursuits but, nevertheless, it does
            sometimes occur. What is really extraordinary is to find a woman of the ability of <mark class="term correct">Qurratu’l-‘Ayn</mark>. Not only did she carry her knowledge of Arabic
            to an unusual degree of perfection, but she became also outstanding in the knowledge of the traditions of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> and of the varied interpretations
            of the disputed passages of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> and of the great writers. In <mark class="term correct">Qazvín</mark>, she was rightly considered a prodigy.” (Ibid., p. 137.)

            insulted and outraged. Eighty <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> bound together in tens, were entrusted to one hundred soldiers, with <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> as their destination. <mark class="term correct">Siyyid</mark>

        <p></p>“Their persecutors, having captured and killed the men, seized and slew forty women and children in the following manner: They placed them in the
            midst of a cave, heaped up in the cave a vast quantity of firewood, poured naphtha over the faggots strewn around, set fire to it. One of those who
            took part in this deed related as follows: <mark class="term unknown">‘After</mark> two or three days I ascended that mountain and removed the door from the cave. I saw that the
            fire had sunk down into the ashes; but all those women with their children were seated, each in some corner, clasping their little ones to their
            bosoms, and sitting round in a circle, just as they were when we left them. Some as though in despair or in mourning, had suffered their heads to
            sink down on their knees in grief, and all retained the postures they had assumed. I was filled with amazement, thinking that the fire had not
            burned them. Full of apprehension and awe, I entered. Then I saw that all were burned and charred to a cinder, yet had they never made a movement
            which would cause the crumbling away of the bodies. As soon as I touched them with my hand, however, they crumbled away to ashes. And all of us,
when we had seen this, repented what we had done. But of what avail was this?<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” (The “<mark class="term misspelled">Tarí<u>kh</u>-i-Jadíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Tárí<u>kh</u>-i-Jadíd</mark>,” pp. 128–31.) “The author of the “<mark class="term unknown">Tarí</mark>            <mark class="term unknown"><u>kh</u>-i-Jadíd</mark>,” in concluding this narrative, takes occasion to point out how literally was fulfilled in these events the prophecy contained in
            the tradition referring to the signs which shall mark the appearance of the <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark>: <mark class="term unknown">‘In</mark> Him (shall be) the perfection of Moses, the

            heads of the Turk and the Daylamite are exchanged as presents; they shall be slain and burned, and shall be afraid, fearful, and dismayed; the
            earth shall be dyed with their blood, and lamentation and wailing shall prevail amongst their women; these are my saints indeed.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark> [This tradition,
            called <mark class="term unknown">Hadí<u>th</u>-i-Jabír</mark>, is also quoted from the “<mark class="term correct">Káfí</mark>,” one of the principal compilations of <mark class="term unknown"><u>sh</u>í’ite</mark> traditions, in the “<mark class="term unknown">Íqán</mark>.”] When
            I was at <mark class="term correct">Yazd</mark> in the early summer of 1888, I became acquainted with a <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> holding a position of some importance under government, two of whose
            ancestors had taken a prominent part in the suppression of the <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> insurrection. Of what he told me concerning this the following is a summary
            taken from my diary for May 18th, 1888: <mark class="term unknown">‘My</mark> maternal grandfather <mark class="term correct">Mihr-‘Alí</mark> <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> <mark class="term misspelled"><u>Sh</u>ujá’u’l-Mulk</mark> <mark class="term correction"><u>Sh</u>ujá‘u’l-Mulk</mark> and my <mark class="term unknown">great-uncle</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Na’ím</mark> <mark class="term correction">Na‘ím</mark> both
            took an active part in the <mark class="term correct">Nayríz</mark> war—but on the wrong side. When orders came to <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> to quell the insurrection, my grandfather was
            instructed to take command of the expedition sent for that purpose. He did not like the task committed to him and communicated his reluctance to
            two of the <mark class="term correct">‘ulamás</mark>, who, however, reassured him, declaring that the war on which he was about to engage was a holy enterprise sanctioned by
            Religion, and that he would receive reward therefor in Paradise. So he went, and what happened happened. After they had killed 750 men, they took
            the women and children, stripped them almost naked, mounted them on donkeys, mules, and camels, and led them through rows of heads hewn from the
            lifeless bodies of their fathers, brothers, sons, and husbands towards <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>. On their arrival there, they were placed in a ruined
            caravanserai just outside the <mark class="term correct">Iṣfáhán</mark> gate and opposite to an <mark class="term unknown">Imám-zadih</mark>, their captors taking up their quarters under some trees hard by. Here
            they remained a long while, subjected to many insults, and hardships, and many of them died. Now see the judgment of God on the oppressors; for of
            those chiefly responsible for these cruelties not one but came to a bad end and died overwhelmed with calamity. My grandfather <mark class="term correct">Mihr-‘Alí</mark> <u>Kh</u>
            <mark class="term unknown">án</mark> presently fell ill and was dumb till the day of his death. Just as he was about to expire, those who stood round him saw from the movement of
            his lips that he was whispering something. They leant down to catch his last words and heard him murmur faintly “<mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>! <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>! <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark>!” three times.
            Then he fell back dead. My <mark class="term unknown">great-uncle</mark> <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term misspelled">Na’ím</mark> <mark class="term correction">Na‘ím</mark> fell into disgrace with the government and was twice fined ten thousand <mark class="term misspelled">túmans</mark> <mark class="term correction">túmáns</mark> the first time,
            fifteen thousand the second. But his punishment did not cease here, for he was made to suffer diverse tortures. His hands were put in the “<mark class="term unknown">il-chik</mark>”
            (the torture consists in placing pieces of wood between the victims fingers, binding them round tightly with cord. Cold water is then thrown over
            the cord to cause its further contraction) and his feet in the “<mark class="term unknown">tang-i-Qájár</mark>” (or “<mark class="term correct">Qájár</mark> squeeze,” an instrument of torture resembling the “boot”
            once used in England, for the introduction of which Persia is indebted to the dynasty which at present occupies the throne); he was made to stand
            bareheaded in the sun with treacle smeared over his head to attract the flies; and, after suffering these and other torments yet more painful and
            humiliating, he was dismissed a disgraced and ruined man.<mark class="term unknown">’</mark>” (“A Traveller’s Narrative,” Note H, pp. 191–3.)

            Gobineau, writing in about the year 1865, testifies as follows: “Public opinion holds that the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> are to be found in every social class and
            among the members of every religion, with the exception of the Nusayris and the Christians, but it is especially the educated classes, the men of
            learning who are suspected of sympathy with <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark>. It is believed, and with good reason, that many <mark class="term correct">mullás</mark> and, among them, outstanding <mark class="term correct">mujtahids</mark>,
            magistrates of high rank, and high court officials very close to the king, are <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>. According to a recent estimate, there would be in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, a
            city of about eighty thousand souls, five thousand <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>. But this estimate is not very reliable and I am inclined to think that, if the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> were
            to triumph in Persia, their number in the capital would be much larger, for, at that moment, one would have to add to the number of the zealous
            ones, whatever that number may now be, a large proportion of those who are recently in favor of the officially condemned doctrine and to whom
            victory would impart the courage to declare their faith openly.” (Les Religions et les Philosophies dans <mark class="term unknown">l’Asie</mark> Centrale,” p. 251.) “Half a century
            has not yet elapsed since <mark class="term correct">Mírzá</mark> <mark class="term correct">‘Alí-Muḥammad</mark>, the young Seer of <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark>, first began to preach the religion which now counts its martyrs by
            hundreds and its adherents by hundreds of thousands; which seemed at one time to menace the supremacy alike of the <mark class="term correct">Qájár</mark> dynasty and of the
            <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadan</mark> faith in Persia, and may still not improbably prove an important factor in the history of Western Asia.” (E. G. Browne’s introduction to
            the “<mark class="term misspelled">Tarí<u>kh</u>-i-Jadíd</mark> <mark class="term correction">Tárí<u>kh</u>-i-Jadíd</mark>,” p. 7.) “<mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark>,” writes Professor James Darmesteter, “which diffused itself in less than five years from one end of
            Persia to another, which was bathed in 1852 in the blood of its martyrs, has been silently progressing and propagating itself. If Persia is to be
            at all regenerate it will be through this new faith.” (Extract from “Persia: A Historical and Literary Sketch,” translated by G. K. Nariman.) “If
            <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark> continues to grow at its present rate of progression, a time may conceivably come when it will oust <mark class="term unknown">Muḥammadanism</mark> from the field in Persia.
            This, I think, it would be unlikely to do, did it appear upon the ground under the flag of a hostile faith. But since its recruits are won from the
            best soldiers of the garrison whom it is attacking, there is greater reason to believe that it may ultimately prevail. To those who know anything
            of the Persian character, so extraordinarily susceptible of religious influences as it is, it will be obvious to how many classes in that country
            the new creed makes successful appeal. The <mark class="term correct">Súfís</mark>, or mystics, have long held that there must always be a Pir, or Prophet, visible in the flesh, and
            are very easily absorbed into the <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> fold. Even the orthodox Musulman, whose mind’s eye has ever been turned in eager anticipation upon the
            vanished <mark class="term correct">Imám</mark>, is amenable to the cogent reasoning, by which it is sought to prove that either the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, or <mark class="term correct">Bahá</mark>, is the <mark class="term correct">Mihdí</mark>, according to all the
            predictions of the <mark class="term correct">Qur’án</mark> and the traditions. The pure and suffering life of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, his ignominious death, the heroism and martyrdom of his
            followers, will appeal to many others who can find no similar phenomena in the contemporaneous records of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>.” (Lord Curzon’s “Persia and the
            Persian Question,” vol. 1, p. 503.) The author, in the same chapter, commenting on the prospects of Christian missionary enterprise in Persia,
            writes as follows: “Persia has even been described as the most hopeful among the fields of missionary labour in the East. While conscious of the
            valuable work that has been and is being done by the representatives of English, French, and American Mission societies in that country, by the
            spread of education, by the display of charity, by the free gift of medical assistance, by the force of example, and while in no way suggesting
            that these pious labours should be slackened, I am unable, from such knowledge as I possess, to participate in so sanguine a forecast of the
            future.” (p. 504.) “...In Persia, however, not the least of the obstacles with which Christian communities are confronted arise from their own
            sectarian differences, and the <mark class="term misspelled">Musulmans</mark> <mark class="term correction">Musulmáns</mark> are perfectly entitled to scoff at those who invite them to enter a flock the different members of which
            love each other so bitterly. Protestants squabble with Roman Catholics, Presbyterians with Episcopalians, the Protestant Nestorians look with no
            very friendly eye upon the Nestorians proper, and these, again, are not on the most harmonious terms with the Chaldaeans, or Catholic Nestorians.
            The Armenians gaze askance upon the United (or Catholic) Armenians, and both unite in retarding the work of the Protestant missions. Finally, the
            hostility of the Jews may, as a rule, be reckoned upon. In the various countries of the East in which I have traveled, from Syria to Japan, I have
            been struck by the strange and, to my mind, sorrowful phenomenon, of missionary bands waging the noblest of warfares under the banner of the King
            of Peace with fratricidal weapons in their hands.” (Pp. 507–8.) “...If, then, the criterion of missionary enterprise in Persia be the number of
            converts it has made from <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>, I do not hesitate to say that the prodigious expenditure of money of honest effort, and of sacrificing toil that
            has been showered upon that country has met with a wholly inadequate return. Young <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadans</mark> have sometimes been baptised by Christian
            missionaries. But this must not too readily be confounded with conversion, since the bulk of the newcomers relapse into the faith of their fathers
            and I question if, since the day when Henry Martyn set foot in <mark class="term correct"><u>Sh</u>íráz</mark> up till the present moment, half a dozen Persian <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadans</mark> have
            genuinely embraced the Christian creed. I have myself often enquired for, but have never seen, a converted Musulman (I exclude, of course, those
            derelicts or orphans of Musulman parents who are brought up from childhood in Christian schools). Nor am I surprised at even the most complete
            demonstration of failure. Putting aside the dogmatic assumptions of Christianity (e.g. the doctrine of the Trinity and the Divinity of Christ),
            which are so repugnant to the <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadan</mark> conception of the unity of God, we cannot regard the reluctance of a Musulman to desert his faith with
            much astonishment when we remember that the penalty for such an act is death. The chances of conversion are remote indeed so long as the body as
            well as the soul of the convert is thrown into the scales But personal apprehensions, though an important are not the deciding factor in the
            situation. It is against the impregnable <mark class="term unknown">rock-wall</mark> of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> as a system embracing every sphere, and duty, and act of life, that the waves of
            missionary effort beat and buffet in vain. Marvellously adapted alike to the climate, character and occupations of those countries upon which it
            has laid its adamantine grip, <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> holds its votary in complete thrall from the cradle to the grave. To him, it is not only religion, it is
            government, philosophy, and science as well. The <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadan</mark> conception is not so much that of a state church as, if the phrase may be permitted, of
            a church state. The undergirders with which society itself is warped round are not of civil, but of ecclesiastical, fabrication, and, wrapped in
            this superb, if paralysing creed, the Musulman lives in contented surrender of all volition, deems it his highest duty to worship God and to
            compel, or, where impossible, to despise those who do not worship Him in the spirit, and then dies in sure and certain hope of Paradise. So long as
            this <mark class="term unknown">all-compelling</mark>, <mark class="term unknown">all-absorbing</mark> code of life holds an Eastern people in its embrace, determining every duty and regulating every act of
            existence, and finally meting out an assured salvation missionary treasure and missionary <mark class="term unknown">self-denial</mark> will largely be spent in vain. Indeed, an
            active propaganda is, in my judgment, the worst of policies that a Christian mission in a bigoted Musulman country can adopt and the very tolerance
            with which I have credited the Persian government is in large measure due to the prudent abstention of the Christian missionaries from avowed
            proselytism.” (Pp. 508–9.)
        <p></p>Gobineau, writing about the year 1865, gives the following testimony: “Thus <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark> has won a considerable influence on the mind of Persia, and
            spreading beyond the Persian frontier, has overflowed into the pachalick of <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark> and penetrated into India. Among its characteristics,
            one of the most striking is that, even during the life of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark>, many of the new faith, many of its most convinced and devoted followers, have
            never known personally their prophet and do not seem to have attached great importance to the hearing of his instructions from his own lips.
            Nevertheless, they rendered him, completely and without reservation, the honors and the veneration to which, in their own eyes, he was certainly
            entitled.” (Comte de Gobineau’s “Les Religions et les Philosophies dans <mark class="term unknown">l’Asie</mark> Centrale,” p. 255.)
        <p></p>†††††]
            “The Cause of the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> is on the road to great achievements. We have now shown how there has taken place a religious movement which absorbs the
            deepest attention of Central Asia, that is to say, of Persia, several regions of India and a section of Asiatic Turkey; a religious movement,
            therefore, truly remarkable and worthy of being studied. Through it, we witness events, manifestations, catastrophes such that one could only
            imagine possible in remote ages when the great religions were born. I even confess that if I were to see appear in Europe a religion like unto
            <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark>, with advantages such as <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark> possesses, with complete faith, an undaunted enthusiasm, tried courage and proven devotion, winning the
            respect of the indifferent, frightening its adversaries and, moreover, a tireless proselytism constantly gaining adherents in every social
            class,—if I were to see such a phenomenon in Europe, I would not hesitate to predict that, within a given time, power and sovereignty would of
            necessity belong to a group so richly endowed.” (Comte de Gobineau’s “Les Religions et les Philosophies dans <mark class="term unknown">l’Asie</mark> Centrale,” pp. 116, 293–294.)
        <p></p>“It seems certain that from the religious standpoint and especially from the moral one, <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark> marks an advance over the teachings of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark>; one
            may hold with M. Vambery (French Academy, March 12, 1892) that its leader has expressed doctrines worthy of the greatest thinkers.... In any case
            the growth of <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark> is an interesting chapter in the history of modern religions and civilization. And thus, after all is said, those who praise
            it are perhaps right; it may be that from <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark> will come the regeneration of the Persian peoples, even of the whole of <mark class="term correct">Islám</mark> which is in real
            need of it. Unfortunately there is seldom a national regeneration without much shedding of blood.” (M. J. Balteau’s “Le <mark class="term unknown">Bábisme</mark>,” p. 28.)
        <p></p>“Now it appears to me that the history of the <mark class="term correct">Bábí</mark> movement must be interesting in effort ways to others besides those who are directly engaged in
            the study of Persian. To the student of religious thought it will afford no little matter for reflection; for here he may contemplate such
            personalities as by lapse of time pass into heroes and <mark class="term unknown">demi-gods</mark> still unobscured by myth and fable he may examine by the light of concurrent and
            independent testimony one of those strange outbursts of enthusiasm, faith, fervent devotion, and indomitable heroism—or fanaticism, if you
            will—which we are accustomed to associate with the earlier history of the human race; he may witness in a word, the birth of a faith which may not
            impossibly win a place amidst the great religions of the world. To the ethnologist also it may yield food for thought as to the character of a
            people who, stigmatised as they often have been as selfish, mercenary, avaricious, egotistical, sordid, and cowardly, are yet capable of exhibiting
            under the influence of a strong religious impulse a degree of devotion, disinterestedness, generosity, unselfishness, nobility, and courage which
            may be paralleled in history, but can scarcely be surpassed. To the politician, too, the matter is not devoid of importance; for what changes may
            not be effected in a country now reckoned almost as a cypher in the balance of national forces by a religion capable of evoking so mighty a spirit?
            Let those who know what <mark class="term correct">Muḥammad</mark> made the Arabs, consider well what the <mark class="term correct">Báb</mark> may yet make the Persians.” (E. G. Browne’s introduction to “A
            Traveller’s Narrative,” pp. 8–9.)
        <p></p>“So here at <mark class="term unknown">Bahjí</mark> was I installed as a guest, in the very midst of all that <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark> accounts most noble and most holy; and here did I spend five
            most memorable days, during which I enjoyed unparalleled and <mark class="term unknown">unhoped-for</mark> opportunities of holding intercourse with those who are the very
            <mark class="term unknown">fountain-heads</mark> of that mighty and wondrous spirit which works with invisible but <mark class="term unknown">ever-increasing</mark> force for the transformation and quickening of a
            people who slumber in a sleep like unto death. It was in truth a strange and moving experience, but one whereof I despair of conveying any save the
            feeblest impression. I might, indeed, strive to describe in greater detail the faces and forms which surrounded me, the conversations to which I
            was privileged to listen, the solemn melodious reading of the sacred books, the general sense of harmony and content which pervaded the place, and
            the fragrant shady gardens whither in the afternoon we sometimes repaired; but all this was as nought in comparison with the spiritual atmosphere
            with which I was encompassed. Persian Muslims will tell you often that the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> bewitch or drug their guests so that these, impelled by a
            fascination which they cannot resist, become similarly affected with what the aforesaid Muslims regard as a strange and incomprehensible madness.
            Idle and absurd as this belief is, it yet rests on a basis of fact stronger than that which supports the greater part of what they allege
            concerning this people. The spirit which pervades the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> is such that it can hardly fail to affect most powerfully all subjected to its
            influence. It may appeal or attract: it cannot be ignored or disregarded. Let those who have not seen disbelieve me if they will; but, should that
            spirit once reveal itself to them, they will experience an emotion which they are not likely to forget.” (Ibid., pp. 38–9.)
        <p></p>“It will thus be seen that, in its external organisation, <mark class="term unknown">Bábism</mark> has undergone great and radical changes since it first appeared as a proselytising
            force half a century ago. These changes, however, have in no wise impaired, but appear, on the contrary, to have stimulated, its propaganda, which
            has advanced with a rapidity inexplicable to those who can only see therein a crude form of political or even of metaphysical fermentation. The
            lowest estimate places the present number of <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> in Persia at half a million. I am disposed to think, from conversations with persons well
            qualified to judge, that the total is nearer one million. They are to be found in every walk of life, from the ministers and nobles of the Court to
            the scavenger or the groom, not the least arena of their activity being the Musulman priesthood itself. It will have been noticed that the movement
            was initiated by siyyids, <mark class="term unknown">ḥájís</mark>, and <mark class="term correct">mullás</mark>—i.e. persons who, either by descent, from pious inclination, or by profession, were intimately
            concerned with the <mark class="term correct">Muḥammadan</mark> creed; and it is among even the professed votaries of the faith that they continue to make their converts. Many <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark>
            are well known to be such, but, as long as they walk circumspectly, are free from intrusion or persecution. In the poorer walks of life the fact
            is, as a rule, concealed for fear of giving an excuse for the superstitious rancour of superiors. Quite recently the <mark class="term correct">Bábís</mark> have had great success
            in the camp of another enemy, having secured many proselytes among the Jewish populations of the Persian towns. I hear that during the past year
            they are reported to have made 150 Jewish converts in <mark class="term correct">Ṭihrán</mark>, 100 in <mark class="term correct">Hamadán</mark>, 50 in <mark class="term correct">Ká<u>sh</u>án</mark>, and 75 per cent of the Jews at <mark class="term unknown">Gulpayigán</mark>.”
            (Lord Curzon’s “Persia and the Persian Question,” vol. 1, pp. 499–500.)
        <p></p>“From that subtle race,” writes Dr. J. Estlin Carpenter, “issues the most remarkable movement which modern <mark class="term unknown">Muḥammadanism</mark> has produced.... Disciples
            gathered round him, and the movement was not checked by his arrest, his imprisonment for nearly six years and his final execution in 1850.... It,
            too, claims to be a universal teaching; it has already its noble army of martyrs and its holy hooks; has Persia, in the midst of her miseries,
            given birth to a religion which will go round the world?” (“Comparative Religion,” pp. 70, 71.)
        <p></p>“Once again,” writes Professor E. G. Browne, “in the world’s history has the East vindicated her claim to teach religion to the West, and to hold
            in the Spiritual World that preeminence which the Western nations hold in the Material.” (Introduction to M. H. <mark class="term unknown">Phelps’</mark> “Life and Teachings of
            <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Abbás</mark> Effendi,” p. 15.)

            <mark class="term correct">‘Abdu’l-Bahá</mark>’s title.
        <p></p>§§§§§]
            “The Caliphate began with the election of <mark class="term correct">Abú-Bakr</mark> in A.D. 632 and lasted until A.D. 1258, when Hulagu <mark class="term correct"><u>Kh</u>án</mark> sacked <mark class="term correct">Ba<u>gh</u>dád</mark> and put
            <mark class="term unknown">Mu’tasim-Bi’llah</mark> to death. For nearly three centuries after this catastrophe the title of Caliph was perpetuated in Egypt by descendants of the
            House of <mark class="term misspelled">Abbás</mark> <mark class="term correction">‘Abbás</mark> who lived under the protection of its Mameluke rulers, until in A.D. 1517 <mark class="term correct">Sulṭán</mark> <mark class="term unknown">Salím</mark>, the Osmanli, having conquered the Mameluke
            dynasty induced the helpless Caliph to transfer to him the title and insignia.” (P. M. <mark class="term unknown">Sykes’</mark> “A History of Persia,” vol. 2, p. 25.)
