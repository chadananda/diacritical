### The big idea:

Formatting Bahá’í electronic texts is a pain. Even the best quality electronic texts from the BWC contain thousands of errors. And by far the most common type of error is the darned diacritcals on all those transliterated Arabic and Persian terms.

This project attempts to address that fundamental problem by building an authoritative dictionary of correctly spelled terms and names. These can then be used as the basis for automated replacement and suggestion systems.

This repository is the tokenizing auto-replacement script which correctly parses text and HTML and replaces out terms using a dictionary of correct terms.

The project to actually gather the massive correct dictionary is over here:
