# Diacritical
_A Transliteration-Dictionary Based Suggestion Library_

### Example: http://chadananda.github.io/diacritical
### Test harness: http://chadananda.github.io/diacritical/tests


### The big idea:

Formatting Bahá’í electronic texts is a pain. Even the best quality electronic texts from the BWC contain thousands of errors. And by far the most common type of error is the darned diacritcals on all those transliterated Arabic and Persian terms.

This project attempts to address that fundamental problem by providing an automated replacement and suggestion system which can utilize a dictionary of authoritatively spelled terms.  

The project to actually gather that massive correct dictionary is over here:
